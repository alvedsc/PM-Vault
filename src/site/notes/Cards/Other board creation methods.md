Any user can create a board. There are two ways to create a [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]]:
- Boards are created with **new projects** and can reference **existing projects** (if you're a Jira admin). This is what was observed in [[Cards/Board & project relationships\|Board & project relationships]]. 
- Boards can also be based on an **existing filter query** or can copy an **existing board**.
- Another board can technically created using [[Cards/Kanban sub-filter\|Kanban sub-filter]]s but this only applies for [[Cards/Kanban\|kanban]]


## Create a board based on an existing filter

You can create a board based on an existing [[Cards/Filters\|filters]]. 

- When you have access to a saved filter
	- To create a [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]] based on an existing filter, you must already have access to a saved filter: either one you own, or one that has been shared with you.
- When you don't have access to a saved filter
	- If you don't already have a saved filter, simply define a new filter and save it.  It will appear in the list of saved filters when you choose to create a [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]] from a saved filter, and you can choose it as the source of the new [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]].

## Copy an existing board

You can also copy an existing [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]]. 

- Who owns the [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]]?
	- When you copy an existing board, you become the owner of the new board, but not necessarily the owner of the [[Cards/Filters\|filter]].
- Can you change the [[Cards/Filters\|filter]]?
	- You will not be able to edit the filter, but you can switch to another filter.
- Who can use the [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]]?
	- The copied board is automatically shared with the users of the original board. The Share dashboards and filters global permission is not required.
