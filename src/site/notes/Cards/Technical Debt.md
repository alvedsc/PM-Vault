# What could be the impact of technical debt going unchecked?

- It takes far longer to implement [[Cards/Requirements\|Requirements]].
- Doing things over and over (Rewriting)
- Loss of trust from the business people: i.e., things are too slow with Tech.
- Slowing down the release of features.
- Demotivated workers (who wants to work with messy code?)
- Predictability is greatly impacted.
