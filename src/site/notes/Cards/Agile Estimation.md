**Objective**: To assign a number to the complexity of a task in the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]]. This is important to determine the amount of work to be added to the [[Cards/Sprint Backlog\|Sprint Backlog]]. It also is used to calculate [[Cards/Team Velocity\|Team Velocity]] and other [[Cards/Agile KPIs\|Agile KPIs]]  

*Why do we estimate?*
- Determining which pieces of work can be done within a release or iteration.

*How are estimates created?*
- By progressing through the stages of planning.

*How should estimates be stated?*
- It should be started in ranges.

*When do we estimate?*
- Throughout the project. More detail in the later parts of the project. (See [[Cards/Rolling Wave Planning\|Rolling Wave Planning]])

*Who estimates?*
- Team members will do their estimates.

# How to perform Agile Estimation

[[Cards/Agile Estimation\|Agile Estimation]] happens during [[Cards/Backlog Refinement\|Backlog Refinement]] sessions. 

[[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] are assigned on a Fibonacci Sequence estimation because these numbers make more sense to the brain than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. 

## The Fibonacci Sequence
![Agile Estimation.03-07-2023.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Agile%20Estimation.03-07-2023.png)

We use Fibonacci because it is more intuitive than a sequence of natural numbers. For example, a 3-effort is a 1+2-effort. 

> [!hint]
> If you have issues coming up with a number, ask the following questions: 
> - ﻿﻿Is it complex work?
> - ﻿﻿Is it arduous?
> - ﻿﻿Is it both?
> - ﻿﻿Have we done such work before?

Then, to make it easier, we label ranges of numbers in the Fibonacci series with names that are easier to understand. For example:

If the [[Cards/User Stories\|User Stories]] are large, you might consider [[Cards/Splitting User Stories\|splitting them]]. 
- Big enough to provide value within a sprint
- ﻿﻿Typically a story should be sized to get 'Done' within 1-3 days.
- ﻿﻿Smaller stories can help reduce uncertainty.
- ﻿﻿Larger stories can hide details & result in estimates being way off.

Everyone on the team can initially evaluate the work based on their intuition and first impressions. If the disparities are considerable, the team members with the highest and lowest scores must explain their results to the rest of the team. The highest score is taken into consideration after the second round of estimates.

Using a [[Cards/Wideband Delphi\|Wideband Delphi]] approach to assign [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] is recommended. This is a group-based anonymous estimation approach. The most common way to implement [[Cards/Wideband Delphi\|Wideband Delphi]] into [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] estimation is called [[Cards/Planning Poker\|Planning Poker]]. It has the advantages of the [[Cards/Wideband Delphi\|Wideband Delphi]] and is a fast and collaborative process.

> [!Note] About Story Points vs. Ideal Time
> [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] and [[Cards/Ideal Time\|Ideal Time]] are measures of effort necessary to complete a [[Cards/Agile Tasks\|Task]] or [[Cards/User Stories\|User Story]]. However, [[Cards/Ideal Time\|Ideal Time]] will vary based on the developer's proficiency. Thus, [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] are a better measure of the effort required to complete [[Cards/Product Backlog Items\|Product Backlog Items]].  

# Alternative Estimation

If [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] or Fibonacci Sequences are not the best for the team, they can use any other measurement or categorization like:

**Affinity Estimating**: Group estimates into categories or Collections
**T-Shirt Sizing**: Grouping tasks in Shirt sizes categories.
