- We deliver reliable results by *engaging customers* in *frequent interactions* and *shared ownership*.
- We expect uncertainty and manage it through *iterations, anticipation, and adaptation*.
- We unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing that *individuals are the ultimate source of value and creating an environment where they can make a difference*.
- We boost performance through *group accountability* for results and shared responsibility for team effectiveness.
- We improve effectiveness and reliability through *situationally specific strategies, processes, and practices.*
