**Objective**: To produce the [[Cards/Risk-Adjusted Product Backlog\|Risk-Adjusted Product Backlog]] from the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]] 

Generating [[Cards/Plan Risk Responses\|Risk responses]] is not very different from [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]]. There are still [[Cards/Strategies for Opportunities\|Strategies for Opportunities]] and [[Cards/Strategies for Threats\|Threats]]. The difference is that in [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]] the responses are added to the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]] in the form of:
- Creating new Risk Response [[Cards/Agile Tasks\|Agile Tasks]] for Actionable Risks
- Eliminating or changing the [[Cards/Agile Tasks\|Agile Tasks]] for Avoided or Mitigated Risks
- [[Cards/Agile Stakeholder Engagement\|Agile Stakeholder Engagement]] and [[Cards/Development Team\|Development Team]] engagement for other tasks. 

Finally, the reprioritization of the backlog is based on measures like 
- Risk rating for [[Cards/Risks\|Risks]] analyzed qualitatively
- [[Cards/Expected Monetary Value\|Expected Monetary Value]], or Impact for [[Cards/Risks\|Risks]] analyzed quantitatively
