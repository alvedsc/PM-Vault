A time box is an allotted interval of time to complete an objective. 
- In a time-boxed event, 
	- Once you achieve the objective, you can finish the event. 
	- If work is not completed within the time period, move it to another time box. 

> [!hint]
> An example of a time-box is a boxing lap. Once one of the contenders is TKOd, the referee ends the time-box. If not, the match continues on the next time box.
> 
> A football time is an example of what a time box is not. The score can keep changing throughout the time, but the referee won't cancel the match until the 45 minutes are over. A football time is called a fixed period of time.

> Work tends to expand to fill the time given
