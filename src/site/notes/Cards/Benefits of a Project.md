The purpose of undertaking any project is to provide some benefit from delivering the project's products. The types of benefits are variable, and a project can have several benefits. Here are some examples:

- Reducing business costs through the automation of a process
- Increasing the sales of a business with new or improved products
- Meeting the requirements of a legislative or regulatory matter

Benefits can be broadly categorized as tangible and intangible benefits. 
- A tangible benefit can be measured, for example, a reduction in operating costs. 
- An intangible benefit is something that cannot be measured accurately, although the effects of this benefit can be seen, for example, brand awareness.
