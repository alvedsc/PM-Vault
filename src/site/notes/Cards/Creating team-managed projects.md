# Project details

- **Descriptive name**: When you create a team-managed project you supply the name. Use a descriptive name for the project so it’s easy to find.
- **Project key**: The project key will be used as the prefix of this project's issue keys (e.g. ’GA-10'). The key is automatically generated from the project name (the first letter of each word). You can change it when you create the project and also later. Choose one that is descriptive and easy to type.
- **Project icon**: A project icon makes the project easier to find. Use a meaningful icon to make the project easier to find. You can use one of the provided avatars or your own image.
- **Access level**: You also choose the appropriate access level.
	- **Open**: Anyone with access to the site can create and edit issues.
	- **Limited**: Anyone with access to the site can view and comment on issues. Only people added to the project can create and edit issues.
	- **Private**: Only people added to the project can create and edit issues. Issues in the project don't appear in search results.
