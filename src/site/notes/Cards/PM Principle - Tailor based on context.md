Each [[Cards/Project\|project]] is unique. We have to tailor the approach to the project 
- Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives, stakeholders, governance, and the environment.
- Using “*just enough*” process to accomplish the desired outcome while maximizing value, managing cost, and enhancing speed. (related to [[Cards/PM Principle - Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions\|Systems Thinking]])

A tailored project approach can produce benefits, such as:
- ﻿﻿Deeper commitment from project team members
- ﻿﻿Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources (More actions than needed)
- ﻿﻿Customer-oriented focus
- ﻿﻿More efficient use of project resources

**Tailoring the method is iterative**, and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project.
# Requirements for teams. 

- Project teams tailor the **proper framework that will enable the flexibility** to consistently produce positive outcomes.
- Project teams discuss and decide on the delivery approach and resources on a proiect-by-project basis.
