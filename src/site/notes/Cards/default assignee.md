The Default assignee role is designated by the [[Cards/Jira project administrator\|project administrator]]  or [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] and is either **Unassigned or the Project lead**.

If no assignee is specified, when an issue is created, the issue will automatically be assigned to the Default Assignee.

It can't be used in any other way, including in permissions and schemes.Â 

The [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] can configure Jira to disallow unassigned issues, in which case the [[Cards/project lead\|Project lead]] is the only choice.
