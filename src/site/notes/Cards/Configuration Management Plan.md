**Configuration**: Identifiable and documented physical characteristics of a product or process.

> [!Note]- Example of configuration of a product
> - **Product**: Car 
> - **Configuration**: 
> 	- It has four wheels
> 	- It has X motor

**Configuration Management**: It tracks different versions and technical specifications, allowing you to fit different replacement parts nicely into the machine instead of having to replace the whole. 
- It focuses on the version control system of *products and assets* instead of [[Cards/Change Management Plan\|Change Management]], which focuses on the project.  
- The configuration management plan tells you which parts are configurable and how the configuration can be performed.

> [!Note]- Example of configuration management
> The configurable product item is the *car's engine*. For a car with a particular model and year, outline the description of the engine and how to replace it in case it fails.

# Elements of Configuration Management 

1. Version control: Ability to check the work done into a shared repository and retrieve a history of all changes performed 
2. Baseline and Release Information: What was the latest version released, and what it contained. Additionally, have a *baseline* readily deployable version at any time in case the latest release did not work. 
3. Perform audits and reviews: Ensure everyone on the [[Project Team\|Project Team]] has been following the versions and configuration management processes, documenting what needs to be documented
4. Document Processes: So anyone can know what is happening at any time. 
5. Standardized processes to build, integrate and deploy scripts:
# Steps of Configuration Management

- Identification - Identify configurable product items (aspects or specs) to be managed, guarded, or configured.
- Status accounting - Record and report data regarding proposed changes and implementation status
- Verification/Audit - Ensure proper management of configuration items. Recording, approval, and tracking of these items.
