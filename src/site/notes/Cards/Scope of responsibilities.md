- Granting user access through project roles
- Managing boards, sprints, and backlogs

- Monitoring the health of Jira projects

## Mission of the Project Administrator

- Make your project easy to use
	- Projects in Jira are where teams manage their work. As the project administrator, you are the owner of your project. It’s up to you to **make your project easy to use so your team can get their work done**.
- Help your team get work done
	- This involves **assigning users to roles that are appropriate to their job tasks, configuring boards, setting up version and releases, and more.**
- Help the Jira administrator
	- You can also **help the Jira administrator** by understanding how Jira works. By being well informed you can **troubleshoot issues, and possibly resolve them**, without having to escalate to the Jira administrator. And when you do need to contact the Jira administrator you can **help them by knowledgeably explaining the problem behavior or requesting changes to be made**.
