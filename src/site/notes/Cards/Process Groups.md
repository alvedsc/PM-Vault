There are 49 processes organized into five **process groups** and ten **Knowledge areas**

You'll see the number of processes in parenthesis in each process group. These processes are found in the [[Cards/Process Groups & Knowledge Areas Table\|Process Groups & Knowledge Areas Table]]

> [!important ]
> You HAVE to #memorize these for the [[Cards/PMP Exam\|PMP Exam]], including:
> - The numbers. 
> - Each of the processes
> - What they are 
> - What their [[Cards/Common Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs\|Common ITTOs]] are

> [!attention]
> The [[Cards/PMBOK Guide - 6th Edition\|PMBOK Guide - 6th Edition]] is written by Knowledge Areas. However, the questions in the [[Cards/PMP Exam\|PMP Exam]] are written by [[Cards/Process Groups\|Process Groups]]. 

# What are the five Process Groups?
- [[Cards/Initiating\|Initiating]] (2) - The project and PM are authorized.
	- The main output is a [[Cards/Develop Project Charter\|Project Charter]]. 
- [[Cards/Planning\|Planning]] (24) - Project objectives and how to reach those objectives with the given constraints are determined.
	- The main output is the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]. 
- [[Cards/Executing\|Executing]] (10) - The project is executed utilizing acquired resources.
	- The main outputs are the [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]]. 
- [[Cards/Monitoring and Controlling\|Monitoring and Controlling]] (12) - Project Performance is monitored and measured to ensure the project plan is being implemented to design specifications and requirements.
	- The main outputs are 
		- Reassurance that the [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]] were done following the plan.
- [[Cards/Closing\|Closing]] (1) - The project and its various phases are brought to a formal end.

> [!note]
> *These process groups are not linear*. You keep changing them throughout the project through [[Cards/Updates\|Updates]] and [[Cards/Change Management Plan\|Change Management]]. For example, when you are [[Cards/Executing\|Executing]], you might lose a resource, so you must go back to [[Cards/Planning\|Planning]]. *This also applies to knowledge areas*: You might be finished with your [[Cards/Scope Management Plan\|Scope Management Plan]], but when you start the [[Cards/Plan Cost Management\|Plan Cost Management]] process, you might realize you need to redo [[Cards/Plan Scope Management\|Plan Scope Management]]  

> [!attention]
> However, for the [[Cards/PMP Exam\|PMP Exam]], they will ask you *what to do next*. The following action will depend on the scenario they are presenting. For example, the [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] want a lot of requirements, so the next step might be to look at costs to set a boundary for the [[project requirements\|project requirements]].
