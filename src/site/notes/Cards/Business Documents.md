# Other Documents

- [[Cards/Agreements\|Agreements]] are normally outputs from the [[Cards/Conduct Procurements\|Conduct Procurements]] process when the organization acts as a buyer. However, when the organization acts as a procurer of a product or service to an external organization, the [[Cards/Agreements\|Agreement]] [[Cards/Initiating\|initiates]] the new [[Cards/Project\|project]].
- [[Cards/Procurement Statement of Work\|Statement of Work]] is also normally an output of the [[Cards/Plan Procurement Management\|Plan Procurement Management]] from a buyer's perspective. It works as a Procurement Baseline for the buyer's needs. However, in the case of a procurer, this also is an input to [[Cards/Initiating\|initiating]] a [[Cards/Project\|project]] that will build those [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]] for the buyer under the conditions detailed.
