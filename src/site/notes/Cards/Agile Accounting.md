[[Cards/Agile Accounting\|Agile accounting]] is different from traditional accounting. 
In [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]], you wait until the project's [[Cards/Verified Deliverables\|Verified Deliverables]] are handed off, and the customer pays to see a [[Cards/Return on Investment\|Return on Investment]].  

In contrast, [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile]] practices [[Cards/Early Value Delivery\|Early Value Delivery]]. To accomplish this, it uses a [[Cards/Minimal Viable Product\|Minimal Viable Product (MVP)]]. This product is placed in the market and generates a [[Cards/Return on Investment\|Return on Investment]] way before the [[Cards/Project\|project]] is finished. 

> [!tip] Remember...
> Agile projects end when the team runs out of money and time.  

Moreover, [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile]] Practices [[Cards/Incremental Value Delivery\|Incremental Value Delivery]].

As a result, each increment funds itself way faster than in [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]], making it easier to get incremental funding.
