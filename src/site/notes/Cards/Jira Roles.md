# Tips for using project roles

-   Understand how your team works and assign project roles accordingly.
    -   Some teams may have a strict hierarchy and only a few individuals should be project and board administrators.
    -   Some teams may work best when all members have full control of the project.
-   A team member may be an administrator of one project, but a regular user in other projects.
-   Job titles donâ€™t necessarily equate to Jira project roles.
