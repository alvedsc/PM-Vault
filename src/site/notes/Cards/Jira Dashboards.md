**Dashboards** are pages that can be configured to display up-to-the-minute information about projects and tasks. Jira provides a default dashboard, but users and administrators can create additional dashboards for their own use or be shared with others. **To share a dashboard you need the [[Cards/Jira global permissions\|global permission]] [[Cards/Share dashboards and filters\|share dashboards and filters]]**

A Jira dashboard is made up of individual components called **[[Cards/Jira gadgets\|gadgets]]**. 

### Who can configure dashboads? 

Jira’s default dashboard is configured by the [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] and is available to all users in the system. **Users can configure their own dashboards** and keep them private or share with other team members.

### Who can view or edit dashboards?

Users can also define the editors for the dashboard so that the editing is limited to the dashboard owner or can be updated by specified users, groups, or project roles.
