The Benefits Management Plan will describe *how the project's [[Cards/Benefits of a Project\|Benefits]] will be delivered and when* they will be delivered.

The inputs to the Benefits Management Plan come from the [[Cards/Business Case\|Business Case]] for the project, which should detail the expected benefits to justify the project.

To measure the delivery of some [[Cards/Benefits of a Project\|Benefits]], such as cost reduction, a baseline study of the current costs within the business is needed so that a comparison can be made following the delivery of the project.

*The Benefits Management Plan will contain the following key items:*

- A description of the benefit that is expected to be delivered
- A schedule for delivering the benefits
- The owner of the benefits
- How the benefit will be measured, including baseline measures if appropriate
- Assumptions and risks considered in determining the benefit

The Benefits Management Plan will be reviewed regularly throughout the project to ensure the declared benefits are still on track for delivery. *Some benefits are delivered over a period of time long after the project delivery, so the tracking and measurement in the plan may extend beyond the completion of the project*. In this case, the benefit's owner will continue to track throughout this period.
