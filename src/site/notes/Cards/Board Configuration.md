- Why configure boards? 
	- Jira boards are the primary way [[Cards/Jira Team member\|team members]] interact with Jira, so it’s important that boards are configured to meet the team’s needs. Fortunately, boards are highly configurable and offer many settings that affect their appearance and functionality. You can:
		-   Add columns to a board
		-   Map workflow statuses to board columns
		-   Edit column names and sequence
		-   Configure [[Cards/swimlanes\|swimlanes]]
			- Do this by going to Board settings, to the [Swimlanes] menu. 
				- Select an appropriate option for [Base swimlanes on]
		-   Specify which issues appear on a board
		-   Edit board quick filters
		-   Customize card colors and displayed issue fields
