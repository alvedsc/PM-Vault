- ﻿﻿Process of **continuous** monitoring of the status of the project and product [[Cards/Scope\|scope]] and managing changes to the [[Cards/Scope Baseline\|scope baseline]].
	- Determines if a scope change has happened.  
	- [[Cards/Scope creep\|Scope creep]] and [[Cards/Gold plating\|Gold plating]] are discovered here.
- It involves checking the state of the [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]]. 
	- Going to the room they are painting to check they are using the correct paint. 
- When [[Cards/Change Requests\|changes]] are made and approved, the [[Cards/Project Baselines\|Project Baselines]] must be adjusted to reflect these changes.

> [!Note]
> The difference between [[Cards/Control Scope\|Control Scope]] and [[Cards/Validate Scope\|Validate Scope]] is that [[Cards/Control Scope\|Control Scope]] is continuously performed throughout the project, while [[Cards/Validate Scope\|Validate Scope]] is performed at the end to generate [[Cards/Verified Deliverables\|Verified Deliverables]].
