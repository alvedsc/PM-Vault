Be prepared for everything that can happen. 

This domain deals with *activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty.*

Effective execution of this performance domain results in the following desired outcomes:
- ﻿﻿An *awareness of the environment* in which projects occur
- ﻿﻿Proactively *exploring and responding to uncertainty.*
- ﻿﻿An *awareness of the interdependence of multiple variables on the project*. ([[Cards/PM Principle - Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions\|Systems Thinking]])
- ﻿﻿The capacity to *anticipate threats and opportunities*
- ﻿﻿*Project delivery with little or no negative impact*
- ﻿﻿*Opportunities are realized to improve project performance and outcomes.*
- ﻿﻿*Cost and schedule reserves are utilized*

Projects happen in environments with varying degrees of **uncertainty**.
- *State of not knowing or unpredictability.*
- It presents *threats and opportunities* that project teams explore, assess, and decide how to handle.

# Concepts in uncertainty 

There are many shades of uncertainty, such as:
- ﻿﻿The **risk** associated with *not knowing future events*
- The ﻿﻿**ambiguity** associated with *not being aware of current or future conditions*
- ﻿﻿The **complexity** associated with *dynamic systems having unpredictable outcomes*.
- The **volatility** that exists in an environment subject to *rapid and unpredictable change.*
	- It can occur when there are ongoing fluctuations in available skill sets or materials.
# How to respond to uncertainty

Options for responding to uncertainty:
- ﻿﻿Gather information
- ﻿﻿Prepare for multiple outcomes.
	- Finish behind, above, or on schedule.
	- Finish on budget, over budget, or under budget.
	- etc
- ﻿﻿Build in resilience

> [!Note]
Every project should have a reserve. Make sure you ask for it with appropriate justification
