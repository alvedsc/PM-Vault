## Visualizing work

What is visualizing work?

- First example is "Todo list"
	- Reminds you of stop
	- Focuses your actions
	- Set priorities (reorganizing the list)
	- Track progress 
- Another example is: A Project Board 
	- One Agile principle is to "Visualize work"
	- A board is an agile tool used to visualize and manage work 
- Reports and Dashboards are also ways to visualize work 

Why visualizing work? 

- To easily see the work of the project 
	- Allows anyone to see the current state of the project to see how it stands to plan
	- Organizes (Self-organizes?) and focuses the team
	- Only work on tasks on the board 
- To manage things 
	- Easy to add and prioritze the work of the project 
	- easy to update the work items
- Improve the way the team is working
	- Can visually identify problems
		- Too may issues in a certain column 


## Workflows

- Set of columns of a board represent a _workflow_ (or process) to complete the work of an issue 
- Workflows are broken down into statuses (or *steps*)

### Boards vs worklows
- A team works using a board
- The board's structure is defined by an underlying workflow 
- We can use a restaurants *Workflow* (top) and model it in a Jira *Board* (bottom)

- Every project automatically has an associated workflow behind the scenes 
- The status field of each issue must be set to a workflow's status (Just like at Apple)

- Boards are a view of issues arranged by status
- Moving an issue on the board changes the value of the status field 
- You can always add a column to a board to match a new need of the team
