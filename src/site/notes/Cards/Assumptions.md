An [[Cards/Assumptions\|Assumption]] is a factor assumed to be true so that planning can be performed. 

[[Cards/Assumptions\|Assumptions]] allow us to continue [[Cards/Planning\|planning]] without checking the validity of every fact. If we couldn’t make assumptions, making any progress with planning would be difficult. 

[[Cards/Assumptions\|Assumptions]] are stored in the [[Cards/Assumptions Log\|Assumptions Log]]. 

The impact of validated and unverified [[Cards/Assumptions\|assumptions]] is specifically captured within the [[Cards/Project Scope Statement\|Project Scope Statement]]. Project teams iteratively identify document, and validate assumptions throughout the project's lifecycle.

In the [[Cards/Identify Risks\|Identify Risks]] process, all known risks are assessed via assumptions analysis to ascertain their inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, and incompleteness. Using these factors of [[assumptions analysis\|assumptions analysis]] improves the project team’s ability to determine an assumption’s validity, thus providing a filter between the Identify Risks process and the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
