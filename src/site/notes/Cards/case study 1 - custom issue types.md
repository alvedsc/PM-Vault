>[!Case]
>"We want to change how we use issue types. We want to track feature requests separate from bugs, replace Task with Engineering Task, and use [[Story\|Story]] as the default issue type."

**How would you meet this requirement?** 

To satisfy the business requirement, the [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] would:

1.  Create a new Feature Request and Engineering Task issue types in the new standard project.
2.  Change the order of issue types in the Issue type scheme.
3.  Change the order of issue types and set the default issue type to Story in the DEV: Scrum Issue Type Scheme (the issue type scheme for the new standard project).
