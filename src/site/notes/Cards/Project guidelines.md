- **Keep it simple:** Complexity does not equal usefulness. Keep workflows, board configurations, dashboards, and project configurations simple and straightforward.
- **Reuse often:** When users/teams are unwilling to standardize business processes, it becomes a barrier to entry for users to change teams and makes administration more complicated. Using shared configurations promotes consistency and predictability.
- **Naming conventions:** Standardize how projects, boards, sprints, etc. are named to make projects easier to maintain and understand. Provide context in your names, such as a prefix that indicates a feature name, business unit, etc., to make searching easier.
- **Test environment:** Before rolling out new configuration changes, it’s advisable to try them on a test site or test project.
- **Satisfy requirements:** A project can only succeed if the team adopts it, so always try to create and configure projects to meet your team’s requirements. It’s important to take time to thoroughly gather requirements and work processes.
- **Role-specific dashboards:** Create dashboards that are tailored to specific roles so that relevant information is made available to the right people.
