- In principle, the idea is to not have high levels of inventory, 
	- Instead using a *Pull* system to match offer and demand. 
- An empty box (kanban) it is a signal to order more
	- Only request something that has been used

## Kanban Objects (or tokens)

### Kanban systems
![Lean and Agile principles.05-05-2023-2.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Lean%20and%20Agile%20principles.05-05-2023-2.png)

- In a restaurant the kanban system is centered around the guest check 
- In a project board the kanban system is centered around the work item Benefits
	- Simple -> Reliable 
	- Visualizes work
	- Efficient
	- Eliminates waste
	- Easy to identify and improve bottlenecks

### Kanban methods
These use the principles of Lean 

## Lean principles
- Why principles
	- ![Lean and Agile principles.05-05-2023-4.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Lean%20and%20Agile%20principles.05-05-2023-4.png)
	- Principles are timeless
	- Practices and tools help implement the principles

- Empower the team: Not only good for business but for employee morale (employees find value in working)
	- Diverse teams
	- Trust in team's decisions
	- Teamwork: Harmony > Skill 
- Visual work
	- Visual control: Kanbans
	- Adnon board: Information board showing location and nature of existing problems 
- Embrace the scientific method: A way to accomplish complex projects
	- It is: 
		- Create hypothesis
		- Build an experiment
		- Observe/learn from results
		- Repeat / iterate
	- This is great because it empowers continuous constant learning
	- Embrace change: We can't read the future, we need to change to suit the changing situations > cope with change and think flexibly
		- Change should not be felt as change, and it should be built into the process 
- Improve flow
	- **Limit the work in progress / smaller batch sizes** 
		- With less work in progress, problems show themselves quite clearly 
		- Small quantities are harder to produce than large quantities but you learn faster from them 
			- Problems can be hidden in the volume of your work and not be discovered until much later
	- **Map value stream**
		- Draw current state of how value is delivered to customers 
		- Draw desired future with higher value for customer
		- Iterate towards the future state
	- **Pull work**
	- **Elimination of waste**
		- Only working on things of high value, so improving the flow
		- Waste generating waste is everywhere
	- **Reduce setup times**
		- Small lot sizes with quick setups
		- You can quickly change models in a line because the setup times are really small 
		- Moving to cloud computer reduces setup times, for example
			- Allows to create instances of compute, use them and destroy, to introduce code into production quickly
	- **Automate what should be automated**
		- Repetitive tasks -> not automated -> waste
	- To be able to improve flow, however, the first thing you need is transparency: Being able to look into reality 
- Build quality in
	- Produce quality products 100% of the time 
	- **The process should identify problems**
		- ![Lean and Agile principles.05-05-2023-6.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Lean%20and%20Agile%20principles.05-05-2023-6.png)
		- One way to do this is by setting WIP limits (?)
	- **Fix problems when they are discovered**
		- delayed work loss. 
		- the sooner you deal with problems, the better
		- ![Lean and Agile principles.05-05-2023-7.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Lean%20and%20Agile%20principles.05-05-2023-7.png)
			- Automated testing -> the process avoids defects
	- **Identify and fix the root cause** (root cause analysis)
		- Asking WHY as many times, and answering it each time, until you arrive at the root cause of the problem

## Agile Manifesto

![Lean and Agile principles.05-05-2023-9.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Lean%20and%20Agile%20principles.05-05-2023-9.png)
Agile mindset: The Agile Values 
- Individuals and Interactions are where the work is done
- Working software is more important than big plans
- Customer collaboration: Partner with customer to discover the best product instead of enforcing it in the contract
- Responding to change: Treat change as normal and continuously manage it

### Principles and ideas of the Agile Manifesto 

Refactoring: Improving something without changing its functionality

## Lean vs Agile

Lean -> Toyota system
Agile -> Participants from Agile Manifesto -> Lightweight alternative to waterfall

Lean is more foundational than agile. You can be Lean and waterfall, but not Agile and waterfall 

### Combined principles:
