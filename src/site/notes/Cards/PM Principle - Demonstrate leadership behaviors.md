*Demonstrate and adapt leadership* behaviors to support *individual and team* needs.

> [!important]
Good leadership is the single key to keeping the team motivated to achieve project success

Effective leadership *promotes project success* and contributes to positive project outcomes.
- It is important to remember that more conflict and misunderstanding can emerge when too many participants attempt to employ project influence in multiple, misaligned directions.

Leadership is *different from authority.*
- Authority is the right to exercise power and control individuals.
- It takes leadership to motivate a people toward a common goal, inspire them to align their individual interests in favor of collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals.

Effective leaders…
- *Adapt their style to the situation, project, deliverable, methodology*.
- **Recognize differences in motivation among project team members**
- By mixing styles and leveraging motivators, any team member or stakeholder can motivate or influence the team regardless of role or position.

Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of *honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct.*
- Check [[Cards/PM Principle - Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward\|Stewardship]] and [[Cards/PM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct\|PM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]]
