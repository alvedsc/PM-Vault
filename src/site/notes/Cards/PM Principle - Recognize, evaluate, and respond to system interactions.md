A system is a set of ***interacting** and **interdependent** components that function as a unified whole*
- PMs Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surrounding the project in a **holistic** way to positively affect project performance.
	- Not only cost or schedule, but everything
	- It also involves interaction with *external systems*, like external [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]], [[Cards/Organizational Structures\|Organizational Structures]], other [[Cards/Project\|projects]], [[Cards/Program Management\|programs]], [[Cards/Portfolio Management\|portfolios]], business [[Cards/Operations management\|operations]] and the [[Project Environment\|Project Environment]] 

> [!example]
An example of a simple systems thinking approach to a project is painting a wall. Painting a wall is more than just the cost of the paint. It i about when to paint, how to paint, why to paint, etc. 

- Systems are **constantly changing**, requiring consistent attention to internal and external conditions.
	- A simple change can trigger several impacts
- *Project teams should also acknowledge this holistic view*
	- Being responsive to system interactions allows project teams to leverage positive outcomes.
	- Systems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system.

> [!Note]
The biggest thing to understand here is for you and the team not to view a project as single elements but as a whole
