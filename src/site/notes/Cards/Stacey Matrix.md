This graph helps determine which [[Project Management Frameworks\|project management framework]] or [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Project Life Cycle Description]] is best for the project. The graph shows how a project behaves and what are the best ways to tackle it depending on 
- **Certainty** (X-Axis): There's agreement on the desired end result but not on **how** to achieve it. No clear links exist between cause and effect. This means recurrent testing might be needed. 
- **Agreement** (Y-Axis): There's certainty on how to do things but not certainty on **what** is the desired end result. Politics becomes an important factor in these types of projects.

A large area on this diagram lies between the anarchy region and regions of the traditional management approaches. Stacey calls this large central region the zone of complexity – others call it the edge of chaos. The traditional management approaches are not very effective in the zone of complexity. Still, it is the zone of high creativity, innovation, and breaking with the past to create new operating modes.

1. **Technical rational decision making**: Management techniques based on gathering past data to predict the future and planning specific paths of action for certain and agreed-upon issues.
2. **Political decision-making**: When there is certainty about outcomes but disagreement on desirable outcomes, politics, coalition building, negotiation, and compromise determine the organization's direction.
3. **Judgemental decision-making**: In cases of an agreement but uncertainty about cause and effect, a shared mission or vision is used as a guide rather than a preset plan.
4. **Chaos**: High uncertainty and disagreements result in breakdown or anarchy. Avoidance is a short-term strategy but not recommended in the long run.
5. **Complexity zone**: The area between chaos and traditional management approaches is known as the zone of complexity or the edge of chaos. It requires new modes of operating, high creativity, and innovation. Managers and leaders need diverse approaches to handle different contexts.

# Definable vs. High Uncertainty

Project work can range from definable to high uncertainty.
- ﻿Definable (High Certainty):
	- ﻿﻿Clear procedures
	- ﻿﻿Proved successful on similar projects
	- ﻿﻿Car production or electrical appliance
- ﻿Uncertainty (Low Certainty):
	- ﻿﻿Not-done-before
	- ﻿﻿High rates of change, complexity, and risk
	- ﻿﻿Software Development, designing a house

[[Cards/Hybrid Project Management\|Hybrid Projects]] have some parts that are definable and other highly uncertain ones. 

For example, in a software development project, 
- *Designing* and *building* have high uncertainty because they are building a piece of software that has never been made before. In these sections of the project, [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]] is much more useful, as dealing with changes is much easier. 
- *Testing* and *Implementing*, on the other hand, have much stricter, repeatable, and especially highly definable procedures that are better handled through [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]].
