An influence diagram is an intuitive visual display of a decision problem. It depicts the key elements, including decisions, uncertainties, and objectives, as nodes of various shapes and colors. It shows influences among them as arrows.

This simple influence diagram depicts a variable describing the situation: 

- A decision – What do we do?
- A chance variable – What’s the outcome?
- A final valuation – How do we like it?

These four node types are the building blocks of decision problems. The influence diagram gives a high-level conceptual view on which you may build a detailed, quantitative model.
