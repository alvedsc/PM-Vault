Value-Based Decomposition
- ﻿﻿Breaks down [[Cards/Requirements\|requirements]] and prioritize them
- ﻿﻿Design the product box

> [!tip] 
> The product box will probably include the most important features of a product. This means value prioritization in the hands of the customer will determine the product's presentation. This can be used in reverse and ask the [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] to design the product box first to obtain the highest value [[Cards/Requirements\|Requirements]] of the product.
