[[Cards/Free Float\|Free Float]] is how much you can delay an [[Cards/Activities (TPM)\|Activity]] without delaying the next activity. 

[[Cards/Free Float\|Free Float]] is calculated as the difference between the current activity's early finish date and the next activity's early start date. 
$$Free \space Float = ES_{next} - EF_{current} $$
