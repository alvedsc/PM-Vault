[[Cards/Float\|Float]] is how much you can delay an [[Cards/Activities (TPM)\|Activity]] without altering the [[Cards/Project Schedule\|Project Schedule]], specifically the project end date. 

Float is calculated as the difference between early start (ES) and late start (LS) dates or between early finish (EF) and late finish (LF) dates.

$$Float = LS - ES \space\lor\space Float = LF - EF$$
