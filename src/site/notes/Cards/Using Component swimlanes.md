You can use [[Cards/swimlanes\|swimlanes]] based on components in boards. To configure this:

1.  Go to Board settings> Swimlanes.
2.  Use the Queries swimlane and enter the appropriate JQL.

**Component swimlanes work best when each issue is associated with only one component value.**Â **Issues with multiple component values only appear in a single swimlane.**
