The Board administrator is designated by the [[Cards/Jira project administrator\|project administrator]] or [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]]. The Board administrator can be one or more users or groups, but is the **board creator by default**.

They can configure the board, like adding columns, configuring card colors, and more.  

The role isn't used in any other way, including in permissions and schemes. 

By default, a board’s creator is automatically assigned as the Board administrator.  A board can have more than one Board administrator.
