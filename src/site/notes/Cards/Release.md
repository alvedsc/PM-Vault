A [[Cards/Release\|Release]], or Product Increment, is several [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprints]] worth of work directed to operations for possible rollout and testing. 

These are very important because they are the set of new features that the users will be able to use. 

Only the [[Cards/Product Owner\|Product Owner]] determines if the work of a [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]] is part of a [[Cards/Release\|Release]]. 

> [!Note]
> An example of work not part of a [[Cards/Release\|Release]] is a feature that depends on another that has not been developed. For example, an invoicing system is useless if there is no way to accept payments. These two features could be part of two different [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprints]], and they would be called [[Cards/Product Increment\|Potentially Shippable Products or Increments]]
