[[Cards/Contingent Response Strategies\|Contingent Response Strategies]] are the ones that get executed only when certain unwanted events occurâ€”these contrast with [[Cards/Strategies for Threats#^e16b92\|mitigation strategies]], which are implemented regardless of any trigger.

> [!important]- Example of a [[Cards/Contingent Response Strategies\|Contingent Response Strategy]]
> **Risk:**
> You are going to address a gathering of professionals. If the car tires get busted, it will delay twenty minutes, and you may miss your speaking slot.
> 
> **The Contingency Plan could be:**
> You keep some buffer time, and if something happens to car tires, you change them, and since you have a timed buffer, you still reach on time.
> 
> **The Mitigation Plan could be:**
> You take one car along, someone follows you, and if there is any problem in the car you are traveling, you change the car.
