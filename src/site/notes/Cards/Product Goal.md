In a nutshell, the Product Goal provides context to the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]]. The Product Goal describes the future state of the product, which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is the **long-term objective** for the Scrum Team.  The [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]] Items define what will fulfill the Product Goal as the Scrum Team learns more about achieving the goal while working each [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]]. The Product Goal is, therefore, a simple directional statement that provides context and purpose (of the work) for the [[Cards/Scrum Team\|Scrum Team]] and its [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]]. 

The Product Goal should be made visible to everyone through the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]], and the [[Cards/Product Owner\|Product Owner]] is [[Cards/PM Principle - Create a collaborative project team environment#^1ab2be\|accountable]] for creating and communicating the Product Goal.
