- Functional Organizations (Departmental)
	- Structure that groups staff members according to their area of expertise (sales, marketing, construction, etc.). Functional structures require the project team members to report directly to the functional manager
- Matrix Organizations
	- There are three matrix structures: weak, balanced, and strong (how much power is given to the [[Cards/Project Management\|pm]]). The different structures are reflective of the project manager's authority in relation to the functional manager's authority.
- Project Oriented Organizations (Projectized)
	- Structure where the PM has the greatest amount of authority. The project team is assigned to the project on a full-time basis. When the project is complete, the project team members moves on to other assignments within the organization.
- Hybrid
	- Blended type

>For the exam, most cases you should assume a strong matrix organization.
>Why? Because you can assume
>1. You are working full time
>2. There is still a functional manager that you get resources from but once you get them you are in charge of them
>3. Once they are in, staff is usually full time in the project
