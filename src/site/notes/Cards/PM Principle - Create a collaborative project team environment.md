-  Project teams are made up of people who have *diverse skills, knowledge, and experience.*
- Synergy
	- Project teams that *work collaboratively* can finish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than individuals working on their own.

Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines, often *establishing their own "local" culture*.

A collaborative project team environment facilitates:
- ﻿﻿*Alignment* with other organizational cultures and guidelines,
- ﻿﻿Individual and team *learning and development*, and
- ﻿﻿*Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes*.

# What affects teams?

- *Principles* 
	- Teams should incorporate **practice standards, ethical codes, and other guidelines** as part of the professional work within the project team and the organization.
- *Respect*
	- A **collaborative project team environment** promotes the free exchange of information and individual knowledge. 
	- People afraid of sharing information won't share it, even if it is in the project's best interest.
