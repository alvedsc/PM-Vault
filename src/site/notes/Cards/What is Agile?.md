- The idea was born out of need because [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]] could not allow for the agility needed in software projects. The formal definition of Agile is present in the [[Cards/Agile Manifesto\|Agile Manifesto]]. Another important event was the [[Cards/Agile Declaration of Interdependence\|Agile Declaration of Interdependence]]
- There are differences between [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|agile]] and [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|waterfall]], including: 
	- Agile looks more like an *incremental process where constant customer [[Feedback\|Feedback]] is required on each increment*. 
		- This way, the *customer is involved throughout the [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Project Life Cycle Description]], interacting more with all the [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]]*. 
	- Agile does *planning throughout the [[Cards/Project\|project]]* instead of all at once. 
	- Agile *delivers products (or modules of an end product) over time* instead of all at once. 
		- This *delivers greater value up-front*, instead of [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]], where you get value at the end. 
	- Agile *encourages change*, unlike [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]] which discourages them. People give [[Feedback\|Feedback]] on change if they feel it will make a difference. 
	- In [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]], [[Cards/Scope\|Scope]] is fixed. In Agile, [[Cards/Scope\|Scope]] is flexible. More info at [[Cards/Inverting the Triangle\|Inverting the Triangle]]
