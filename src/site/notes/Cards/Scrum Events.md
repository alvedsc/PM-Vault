> [!info]
> All events in [[Cards/Scrum\|Scrum]] are [[Cards/Time-box\|Time-boxes]] except the [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]]. Once the [[Cards/Product Backlog Items\|PBIs]] in the [[Cards/Sprint Backlog\|Sprint Backlog]] are finished, the team can add more. This is not possible in [[Cards/Time-box\|Time-box]] events.

> [!important]
> Do not confuse [[Cards/Activities (Scrum)\|Activities (Scrum)]] with [[Cards/Scrum Events\|events]]. Activities are things that have to be completed. They are not related to time but to outcomes. This means they are neither [[Cards/Time-box\|time-boxes]] nor fixed intervals of time. An example of an activity is "Testing the [[Cards/Product Increment\|Product Increment]]" during the [[Cards/Sprint Review\|Sprint Review]] event.
