As the team completes more sprints, the velocity report can help the team more accurately [[Cards/Agile Estimation\|estimate]] future work. The report calculates the team's velocity, essentially the average amount of work the team can complete during a sprint. 

The product owner wants to complete 500 story points in the backlog. We know that the development team generally completes 50 story points per iteration. The product owner can reasonably assume the team will need about ten iterations to complete the required work. The more iterations shown in the report, the more accurate the forecast.

-   The y-axis represents the estimation metric used by the team. 
-   Each vertical bar represents a completed sprint, divided into estimated work versus the actual amount of work completed. 
-   The report displays the team’s last seven sprints.

# Notes

A decrease in average velocity usually indicates that some part of the team's development process has become inefficient and should be brought up at the next retrospective.

During the team's retrospective, ask the following questions:

-   Are there unforeseen development challenges we didn't consider when estimating this work?
-   How can we better break down the work to uncover these challenges?
-   Is there outside business pressure pushing the team beyond its limits? 
-   As a team, are we overzealous in forecasting for the sprint?
