Products and Services have perceived value to them. Everything we invest ourselves into is because there is some value to it. 

- *Continually evaluate and adjust project alignment to business objectives and intended benefits and value*.
	- Is this project still delivering value toward the objective?

- Value is the *ultimate indicator of project success.*
	- Did the product of the project fulfill in delivering value? NO? Failure

- Value can be realized throughout the project (Agile), at the end of the project, or after the project is complete (Waterfall).
	- 
- Value, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in *quantitative and or qualitative terms.*

- A focus on outcomes allows project teams to *support the intended benefits that lead to value creation.*
	- A team focused on value instead of deliverables can negotiate with stakeholders to decrease the chances of project failure.
	- Project teams *evaluate progress and adapt* to maximize the expected value.
	- From the perspective of the customer and end-user 

- A [[Cards/Business Case\|business case]] is an outline of value. It contains at least these supporting and interrelated elements:
	- ﻿﻿Business need
	- ﻿﻿Proiect justification
	- ﻿﻿Business strategy

- Value is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. 
	- Value is subjective because the same concept can have different values for different people and organizations.

- To support value realization from projects, project teams *shift focus from deliverables to the intended outcomes. 
	- Doing so allows project teams to *deliver on the vision or purpose of the project* rather than simply creating a specific deliverable.
