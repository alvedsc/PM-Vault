- Once added, each WMS layer can be composed of several layers that you can turn on and off.
- You have the same options as in any other layer, and you can even *Save the Layer* in your account. Then you can just import it from the Add > Search Layer 


- If you add it as basemap, you have to check with the source if the layer works as a basemap beforehand. It will also only import it as one layer, no matter the number of layers in the WMS. It also has fewer config options since it is a basemap (for example, no deleting the basemap)
