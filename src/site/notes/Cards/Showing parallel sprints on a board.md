Jira doesn’t offer the option to divide a board into swimlanes by sprint, but you can use the Queries [[Cards/Using Component swimlanes\|swimlanes]] condition and [[Cards/JQL\|JQL]] statements to create this. However, you will need to modify the query every time a new sprint is started to include it in the query, so it’s not a very scalable solution.

By making the Sprint field visible on cards, the respective sprints can be easily identified.
