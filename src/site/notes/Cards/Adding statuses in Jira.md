Objective: Adding a status to [[Cards/What is a Jira project\|Jira project]]

Jira ships with a set of default statuses that are used by the default workflows. Click to expand and learn more about our recommendations for adding statuses.

If you add a status to your [[Cards/Jira Workflow\|Jira Workflow]], you may also need to update [[Cards/Filters\|filters]].

# Tips

- **Start simple**
	- When editing your project workflows, don’t over-complicate your workflow. You want to get fine-grained visibility into the status of work, but building a workflow with 20 or 30 statuses results in a workflow nobody wants to use. It’s better to start with a simple workflow, and **add statuses when you need them. When people enjoy using workflows, they’re more likely to keep issues updated**, which means your data is more accurate and actually useful.
- **Add statuses that reflect how people work**
	- Add a new status when work needs to be re-assigned to another person, or when a piece of work is going to be in the same status for a significant period of time. This period of time will differ depending on the workplace and the overall period needed for the workflow to be completed.
- **Use a maximum of seven statuses**
	- Don’t exceed seven statuses in a workflow unless it’s for complex change management or a shared workflow where different phases will be used by different teams.
- **Don’t gather data for the sake of data**
	- Will that data help us make better decisions? Enable us to help our customers better? Will the proposed change be the best way to get that data, or is there a better way we should think about? Don’t gather data for the sake of data. **That will slow down work and negatively impact your team outcomes**.
