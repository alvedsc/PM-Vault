For an enterprise-wide agile practice, Jira Align connects your business strategy to technical execution while providing real-time visibility.

Jira Align allows enterprises to aggregate team-level data and makes all work visible across your enterprise in real-time. All layers of scale are connected, and everyone can get on the same page to determine scope, roadmaps and dependencies across teams and portfolios.

With Jira align you can easily connect strategic investments with customer value created in order to drive outcomes faster and more reliably. It offers out-of-the-box support for all the most popular scaling frameworks such as SAFe, Scrum@Scale, Spotify, LeSS and more. It also allows the configuration of custom, internally developed frameworks. Terminology can be customized to accommodate custom or hybrid models.
