This is what the [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]] must have to be accepted by a customer. 
It could be defined as *Building the right thing*, in contrast to [[Cards/Quality\|Quality]] which is *Building the thing right*. 

Since these are required to be accepted by the customer, these are part of the [[Cards/Definition of Done\|Definition of Done]]. 

[[Cards/Acceptance Criteria\|Acceptance Criteria]] are often visible things, in contrast to [[Cards/Quality\|Quality]] Factors. A customer only realizes a product is low-[[Cards/Quality\|quality]] until it starts failing, but will immediately notice it does not fulfill [[Cards/Acceptance Criteria\|Acceptance Criteria]] before even buying it.
