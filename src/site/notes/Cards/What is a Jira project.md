- **A project is a collection of related issues**
	- A Jira project is a collection of related issues. A project is a way to organize work. The issues can be related in any way that the team desires.
- **A project can act as a team "to do" list**
	- The issues can be in different states, such as not ready for development, ready for development, in progress and done. Jira therefore contains a record of the team’s work, allowing the team to do things like report on their work.
- **A project can have a fixed end date or be an ongoing project**
	- A Jira project is not necessarily a project in the traditional sense, which usually has a start and end date. The term “project” is used loosely to include work that has no planned end date. For example, a product that is planned to continuously be improved, with no plan to ever stop work on it. When this course refers to a “project”, it is meant to be a Jira project.
- **A project has an associated type**
	- Projects have an associated type, depending on how the team wants to accomplish their work. When you create a project, you select its type, such as **Kanban or Scrum**. We will discuss these later in the course. Over time, the team can configure their project to use a **custom agile methodology** or framework.
