**Permission schemes**Â determine who performs certain tasks in a project. They are simply lists of permissions along with users, [[Cards/Jira Groups\|groups]], and [[Cards/Project Roles (Jira)\|roles]] the permissions are associated with.

All schemes are configured by a [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] and then associated with one or more projects. In this way, a set of configurations can be defined once, and then applied to any number of projects.

In this example all permission requirements are the same for all projects, so the [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] creates the [[Cards/Permission schemes\|Permission schemes]] and adds it to the [[Cards/What is a Jira project\|Jira project]]. Then the [[Cards/Jira project administrator\|project administrator]] assings team members to each [[Cards/Project Roles (Jira)\|role]] , and thus they get the permissions in the [[Cards/Permission schemes\|Permission schemes]] associated.
