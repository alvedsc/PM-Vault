Analyzing the communications needs of the stakeholders
- View [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]]' communications individually and then check how they connect to other [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] so you can analyze their needs holistically. 
	- ﻿﻿Lack of communication leads to failure.
	- ﻿﻿Communications Channels
	- ﻿﻿Channels = $n(n-1)/2$
	    *n* = The number of people on the project
