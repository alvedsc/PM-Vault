Here's a picture of a [[Cards/Simplified workflow\|Simplified workflow]] 

- The simplified workflow is an easy-to-use workflow.
- The **simplified workflow** uses only [[Cards/global transitions\|global transitions]], has a resolution that sets and clears automatically, and doesn't have conditions, validators, or transition screens
	- There are no screens for transitions and users can transition an issue from any status to any other status (drag freely between columns).
	- Users who are both board and project administrators can edit the workflow via the board configuration, adding statuses and columns.
	- Once you edit a simplified workflow by adding statuses and transitions, it is no longer a simplified workflow and becomes a [[Cards/custom workflow\|custom workflow]].

>[!info]
> The simplified workflow can only be used if a board represents a single project. If a board was created as a result of creating a project, it will use the simplified workflow.
