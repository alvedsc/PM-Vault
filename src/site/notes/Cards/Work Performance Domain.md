After [[Cards/Planning Performance Domain\|planning]], you have to do the work! 

This domain deals with activities and functions that *establish project processes, manage physical resources, and foster a learning environment*.

Project work is connected with *establishing the processes and performing the work done by the project team* to deliver the expected deliverables and outcomes.

**Outcomes include:**
- ﻿﻿Efficient and effective project performance.
- ﻿﻿Project processes are suitable for the project and the environment.
- ﻿﻿Appropriate communication with stakeholders.
- ﻿﻿Efficient management of physical resources.
- ﻿﻿Effective management of procurements, like vendor management 
- ﻿﻿Improved team capability due to continuous learning and process improvement.

# Implications of project work

Project work keeps the project team dedicated and project activities running correctly. This includes but is not limited to:
- ﻿﻿*Managing the flow* of existing, new, and change work.
- ﻿﻿Keeping the *project team focused.*
	- **Project managers are responsible** for assessing and balancing the project team's focus and attention.
	- Don't let the team have to deal with other stuff than doing the work
- ﻿﻿Establishing *efficient project systems and processes*
	- The project manager and the project team establish and periodically *review the processes* used to conduct the work.
		- This can take the form of reviewing task boards such as using Kanban.
		- Process tailoring can be used to optimize the process for the needs of the project
		- Balancing constraints can be fixed delivery dates, compliance with regulatory codes, a predetermined budget, and quality.
- ﻿﻿*Communicating with stakeholders*
	- Much of the project work is associated with communication and engagement.
- ﻿﻿*Managing physical resources*
	- Planning, ordering, transporting, storing, tracking, and controlling these physical resources can take much time and effort.
- ﻿﻿*Working with external vendors*
	- Working on procurements which can involve hiring and managing vendors throughout the project. This includes managing bids and contracts.
- ﻿﻿*Monitoring changes* for product or project 
- ﻿﻿*Enabling project learning and knowledge transfer.* This does not necessarily happen at the end of the project only.
	- From time to time, the project team may meet to determine what they can do better in the future (lessons learned) and how they can improve and challenge the process in upcoming iterations (retrospectives).
