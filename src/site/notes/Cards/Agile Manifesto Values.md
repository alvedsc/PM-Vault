We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

*Individuals & interactions* over *Processes & tools*
{ #5e6530}

- Projects are about [[Cards/PM Principle - Engage Stakeholders\|people]]. 
- People use the tools to deliver [[Cards/PM Principle - Focus on Value\|value]], so these are necessary. 
- However, the focus should be on [[Cards/PM Principle - Engage Stakeholders\|people]] and their interactions.
- An example of this in practice is, in an Agile project, avoiding cubicles and having open spaces. 

*Working software* over *Comprehensive documentation*
- We need products that work and are easy to use. 
- Focus on value, not paperwork. Paperwork in Agile is *barely sufficient*.
- Delivery *just in time* of products that *do what they should*. 
- Simplify administrative paperwork related to [[schedule\|schedule]], [[costs\|costs]], and [[Cards/Scope\|scope]] control. 

*Customer collaboration* over *Contract negotiation*
- Willingness to be flexible and accommodating towards the customer instead of adhering to strict contracts.
- Manage change, and do whatever it takes to encourage it. 
- A shared [[Cards/Definition of Done\|definition of done]] (DoD)
- Requires trusting relationships with vendors so that we can be flexible and accommodating. 

*Responding to change* over *Following a plan*
- Don't let things be set in stone. Requirements change constantly. The more recent the requirement is, the more relevant it is. 
- Spend effort and energy responding to changes instead of following a plan. 
- The need to respond to change is determined by the complexity of the endeavor, which is shown in the [[Cards/Stacey Matrix\|Stacey Matrix]] 

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, *we value the items on the left more.*
