**Objective**: Check [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]] against quality [[Cards/Constraints\|Constraints]] 

- Assess performance and ensure the project outputs are complete, correct, and meet customer expectations.
	- ﻿﻿Verify that project [[Cards/Deliverables\|deliverables]] and work meet the requirements of key [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]] for final acceptance.
	- ﻿﻿Each deliverable is inspected, measured, and tested. 
- The outputs of this process are the [[Cards/Verified Deliverables\|Verified Deliverables]] which are inputs to the [[Cards/Validate Scope\|Validate Scope]], which is necessary before closing the project. 

> [!attention]
> Improving the quality of the processes is part of the [[Cards/Manage Quality\|Manage Quality]] process. In [[Cards/Manage Quality\|Manage Quality]], the [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change Requests]] to improve the processes are created. There is no process improvement going on in [[Cards/Control Quality\|Control Quality]]. Here you look at the deliverable and affirm whether it is well done.


# ITTOs
## Inputs
- [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]
	 [[Cards/Quality Management Plan\|Quality Management Plan]] - How to do this process
- [[Cards/Project Documents\|Project Documents]]
	- [[Cards/Lessons Learned Register\|Lessons Learned Register]]
	- [[Cards/Quality Metrics\|Quality Metrics]] - What are you checking the [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]] against? 
	- [[Cards/Test and Evaluation Documents\|Test and Evaluation Documents]] - You should check this as you inspect those [[Cards/Deliverables\|deliverables]].
