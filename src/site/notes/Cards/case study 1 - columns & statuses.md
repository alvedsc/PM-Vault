>"We want to apply different statuses to issues moved to a Review column. When users move an issue into the Review column, they need to set the status to either New or Revised."

To satisfy the requirement, the Project administrator:

-   Adds a Review column to the board
-   Creates two new workflow statuses:New and Revised-
-   Adds the two new statuses to theReview column

Users who work with the board will see the newly added Review column. When they drag an issue into the column, the possible status choices will appear, and the users select one simply by dragging the issue on top of the status name.
