This is a [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] estimation method. It uses cards with numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence.

You give all participants cards with the numbers of the sequence. The [[Cards/Facilitation\|Facilitator]] of the [[Cards/Backlog Refinement\|Backlog Refinement]] meeting reads a [[Cards/User Stories\|User Story]] out loud. Then, I give the participants time to think about the number of [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] assigned to the [[Cards/User Stories\|Story]]. 

Everybody then puts their cards face down. Everybody flips the card simultaneously when the facilitator counts down to zero, and each person's estimation is recorded. 

If there seems to be a clear winner, that number is recorded as the number of [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]] required for that [[Cards/User Stories\|Story]]. If not, the biggest number wins.

Of course, this can be changed to allow people on the outliers to express why they gave these scores.
