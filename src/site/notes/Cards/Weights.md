Weights are associated with each connection in our [[Neural Networks\|Neural Networks]]. Every pair of connected nodes will have one weight that denotes the strength of the connection between them. These are vital to the inner workings of a neural network and will be tweaked as the neural network is trained. The model will try to determine what these weights should be to achieve the best result. Weights start out at a constant or random value and will change as the network sees training data.
