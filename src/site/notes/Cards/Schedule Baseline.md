> [!important]
> The [[Cards/Schedule Baseline\|Schedule Baseline]] is part of the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]. The [[Cards/Project Schedule\|Project Schedule]] is **not** part of the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]. The reason is that the [[Cards/Project Schedule\|Project Schedule]] is much more detailed. To change elements in the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]] you need a [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]], and doing this for every schedule change can be too much.
