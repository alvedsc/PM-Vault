Every action we take has risks, including the project. Certain events could impact your [[Cards/Project\|project]].

A risk is an *uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect* on one or more objectives. Risk is the product of an event's [[Uncertainty\|Uncertainty]] (Probability) and [[Impact\|Impact]]. (Check [[Cards/Probability and Impact Matrix\|Probability and Impact Matrix]])

Risks can be positive (opportunities) or negative (threats).

Project teams seek to maximize positive risks (opportunities) and decrease exposure to negative risks (threats).

*Constantly evaluate risk exposure* to opportunities and threats to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts on the project and its outcomes.

Risk responses should be:
- ﻿﻿Appropriate for the *significance of the risk*
- ﻿﻿*Cost-effective*: Don't spend ten dollars to protect five dollars 
- ﻿*Realistic* within the project context,
- ﻿﻿*Agreed to by relevant stakeholders*, and
- ﻿﻿*Owned by a responsible person*.

Project team members *engage with relevant stakeholders* to understand their *risk appetite and thresholds.*
- An organization's risk attitude, appetite, and threshold influence how risk is addressed.
