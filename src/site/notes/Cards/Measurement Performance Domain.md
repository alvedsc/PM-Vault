This domain is about looking at the [[Cards/Work Performance Domain\|Work]] you are doing and asking whether this is going according to [[Cards/Planning Performance Domain\|Plan]] so we can take steps to get it back on track. 

It deals with activities and functions associated with *assessing project performance and taking appropriate actions to maintain acceptable performance*.

Outcomes include:

- ﻿﻿A reliable understanding of the *status of the project.*
- ﻿﻿*Actionable data to enable decision-making.*
	- Accurate and detailed enough
- ﻿﻿*Timely and appropriate actions* to keep the project on track.
- ﻿﻿*Achieving targets and generating business value*

It involves measuring project performance and implementing appropriate responses to *keep the project on track.*

> [!Note]
This domain evaluates how much work done in the [[Cards/Delivery Performance Domain\|Delivery Performance Domain]] meets the metrics identified in the [[Cards/Planning Performance Domain\|Planning Performance Domain]].

Measures are used for multiple reasons, including:
- ﻿﻿Evaluating performance compared to plan.
- ﻿﻿Tracking the utilization of resources
- ﻿﻿Demonstrating accountability
- ﻿﻿Providing information to stakeholders
- ﻿﻿Assessing whether project deliverables are on track
- ﻿﻿Ensuring the project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria.

# How to measure

Creating effective measurements helps to ensure the right things are measured.

Ways to measure performance include:
- ﻿﻿Key Performance Indicators (KPI) - two types of KPIs: leading indicators and lagging indicators:
	- ﻿﻿*Leading indicators* predict changes or trends in the project. **Where are we going?** 
	- ﻿﻿*Lagging indicators* measure project deliverables or events. They provide information after the fact. **How did we do?** 
- ﻿﻿Effective Metrics
	- ﻿﻿Use SMART (Specific, Meaningful, Achievable, Relevant, Timely) criteria.


# What to measure? 

- ﻿﻿Deliverable Metrics
	- ﻿﻿Information on errors or defects
	- ﻿﻿Measures of performance. Is it performing well? 
- ﻿﻿Delivery
	- ﻿﻿Work in progress: too much work in progress? 
	- ﻿﻿Lead time: *How long does it take to do the work?* 
	- ﻿﻿Cycle time: *How long does it take to do the work?* 
	- ﻿﻿Process efficiency
- ﻿﻿Baseline Performance
	- ﻿﻿Start and finish dates.
	- ﻿﻿Actual cost compared to planned cost
- ﻿﻿Resources
	- ﻿﻿Planned resource utilization compared to actual resource utilization
- ﻿﻿Business Value
	- ﻿﻿Cost-benefit ratio
- ﻿﻿Stakeholders
	- ﻿﻿Mood chart: How they are feeling.
- ﻿﻿Forecasts

# How to present metrics?

- ﻿﻿Dashboards
- ﻿﻿[[Cards/Information Radiators\|Information Radiators]]: whiteboards, walls full of information
- ﻿﻿Visual Controls

Pitfalls associated with measurement include:
- ﻿﻿**Hawthorne effect**
	- Measure something so much that you only care about the measurement instead of the success of the whole process. 
		- For example, the faster you make a burger doesn't mean you are making it better.
- ﻿﻿**Vanity metric**
	- They are just made to make the team look good (or bad, even though they are doing their best)
		- This leads to **Demoralization**.
- ﻿﻿**Misusing the metrics**
	- We track metrics but use them badly, derailing the project.
- ﻿﻿**Confirmation bias**
	- We measure what we want in a way we see what we want to see 

A portion of measurement is having *agreed-to plans for measures that are outside the threshold of acceptable ranges*.
- Thresholds can be established *for various metrics such as schedule, budget, velocity, and other* project-specific measures.
