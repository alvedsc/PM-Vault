# The difference between the [[Cards/Stakeholder Engagement Plan\|Stakeholder Engagement Plan]] and the [[Cards/Communications Management Plan\|Communications Management Plan]]

The difference between the [[Cards/Stakeholder Engagement Plan\|Stakeholder Engagement Plan]] and the [[Cards/Communications Management Plan\|Communications Management Plan]] is that the [[Cards/Communications Management Plan\|Communications Management Plan]] deals with the project's communication needs. In contrast, the [[Cards/Stakeholder Engagement Plan\|Stakeholder Engagement Plan]] deals with how to meet the needs of the [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] in the project.  

The idea of the [[Cards/Stakeholder Engagement Plan\|Stakeholder Engagement Plan]] is to ask yourself: 
- What would make the stakeholders happier and more engaged? 
	- Having weekly [[Cards/Meetings\|Meetings]] with the customers
	- Having a monthly webinar with senior management. 
The idea of the [[Cards/Communications Management Plan\|Communications Management Plan]] is to determine
- Who's going to get invited to [[Cards/Meetings\|meetings]]? 
- When are they planned to be?
- Where are they going to be?
- What platform will be used for the webinar? 

How is this relevant? 
- Perhaps the meetings are fine, but some specific [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]] are not being invited to [[Cards/Meetings\|Meetings]] that are relevant to them. This should be changed in the [[Cards/Stakeholder Engagement Plan\|Stakeholder Engagement Plan]]. 
- Perhaps the webinars should be more interactive, and the current platform is not the most effective for this purpose. This should be changed in the [[Cards/Communications Management Plan\|Communications Management Plan]]. 
- Both go hand in hand, but understand that you can't communicate with a stakeholder that is not engaged. An unengaged stakeholder is unlikely to attend meetings or check communications with the attention required. Once the stakeholder is engaged, perhaps [[Cards/Project Communications\|Project Communications]] (meeting, email, presentation) with said stakeholder fail to achieve their expected objective (gathering requirements, solving a conflict). This is not a problem of engagement but communication.
