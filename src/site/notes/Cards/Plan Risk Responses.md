- ﻿﻿Developing options, selecting strategies, and agree on ways to address risk in the project
	- Will allocate resources needed to respond to [[Cards/Risks\|Risks]] if they happen
	- Will address all risk

> [!attention]
> Do not plan a risk response if you have not quantified the risks. There is a cost associated with risk responses (as well as non-responses), but you need all the information from these analyses to develop an adequate response. 
> 
> Also, remember that [[Cards/Identify Risks\|Identify Risks]] is done constantly throughout the project's life cycle, and you must constantly reevaluate risks, which means you also need to [[Cards/Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis\|Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis]] and [[Cards/Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis\|Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis]] every time.
