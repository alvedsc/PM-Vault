Addresses *activities and functions associated with [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]]*. These enable:
- A productive working relationship with stakeholders throughout the project.
- Stakeholder agreement with project objectives.

- Defining and sharing a *clear vision* at the start of the project can *enable good relationships and alignment throughout the project.*

Identify
- Identification is done throughout the project to understand who your stakeholders are, both *internal and external*.

> [!Note]
Remember, stakeholders come and go, so this activity is constant

Understand and Analyze
- the project manager and team should seek to *understand stakeholders' feelings, emotions, beliefs, and values*.
- This determines how, when, and why we interact with them.

Prioritize
- *Focus on stakeholders with the most power and interest* as one way to prioritize engagement.

[[Cards/PM Principle - Engage Stakeholders\|Engage]]
- **Working collaboratively** with stakeholders to introduce the project, elicit their requirements, manage expectations, resolve issues, negotiate, prioritize, problem-solve, and make decisions.

Monitor
- Throughout the project, stakeholders will change as *new stakeholders are identified, and others cease to be stakeholders*.
