Objective: Unclutter the Done column in the project board 

[[Cards/Kanban\|kanban]] boards are structured for continuous work. As tasks move through the board, they eventually land in the Done column, where they can accumulate and clutter up the board. **How would you meet this requirement?**

- Configure a **date-based Kanban board**
	- First, you can automatically hide completed issues that have aged in Board settings > General. This is convenient when time is the only criteria. Note that *this option isn't available for scrum boards.*
