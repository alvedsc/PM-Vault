It is based on **three pillars of Empiricism**:

- ﻿﻿Transparency
	- ﻿﻿Everything should be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
	- We welcome feedback 
- ﻿﻿Inspection
	- ﻿﻿Timely checks on how well a project is progressing toward goals
		- This is done constantly in the [[Cards/Daily Stand-Up\|Daily Stand-Up]] and the [[Cards/Sprint Review\|Sprint Review]] 
	- ﻿﻿Looks for problematic deviations or differences from goals
- ﻿﻿Adaptation
	- ﻿﻿Adjusting a process to minimize further issues if an inspection shows a problem or undesirable trend.
