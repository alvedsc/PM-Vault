A form of *[[Cards/Progressive Elaboration\|Progressive Elaboration]]*. *Near-term work packages can be defined in great detail. Long-term work packages may not be able to be defined in any detail*; a placeholder may be created for a later date.

As the project moves along to completion, long-term placeholders will be removed and then allowed to be decomposed into [[Cards/Work Packages\|work packages]] as more details become available.

This planning must constantly be revisited throughout the project's life cycle when long-term work packages can not be clearly defined. This implies the schedule and other [[Cards/Constraints\|Constraints]] will realign at every placeholder.
