**Objective**: [[Cards/Backlog Refinement\|Backlog refinement]] is when the [[Cards/Product Owner\|Product Owner]] and [[Cards/Development Team\|Development Team]] review items on the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|Product Backlog]] to ensure it contains the appropriate [[Cards/Product Backlog Items\|PBIs]] with the right [[Cards/Product Backlog#Attributes of the Product Backlog\|Attributes]], that they are ordered, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery. 

This activity occurs regularly and may be an officially scheduled or ongoing meeting. Some of the activities that occur during this refinement of the backlog include:

- Removing [[Cards/User Stories\|User Stories]] that no longer appear relevant
- Creating new [[Cards/User Stories\|user stories]] in response to newly discovered needs
- [[Cards/Risk-Adjusted Product Backlog\|Adjusting for Risk]]  
	- This would make the [[Cards/Risk-Adjusted Product Backlog\|Risk-Adjusted Product Backlog]] 
- Re-assessing the relative [[Cards/Value-Based Prioritization\|Priority]] of [[Cards/User Stories\|stories]]
- Assigning [[Cards/Agile Estimation\|estimates]] to stories that have yet to receive one
- Correcting [[Cards/Agile Estimation\|estimates]] in light of newly discovered information
- Splitting high-priority [[Cards/User Stories\|user stories]] but too coarse-grained to fit in an upcoming [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]].
