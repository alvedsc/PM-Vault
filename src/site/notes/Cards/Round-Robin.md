Sometimes in [[Cards/Meetings\|Meetings]], only one or two people dominate the [[Conversation\|Conversation]]. However, many times the most significant contributions. 

[[Cards/Round-Robin\|Round-Robin]] is a technique used to enable everyone to participate in the [[Cards/Meetings\|Meeting]]. It consists of using a token that is passed around, and only the person with the token talks.

The idea is to get everyone to participate in the first few minutes of the [[Cards/Meetings\|meeting]]. This is so that they feel welcome into the [[Conversation\|Conversation]]. Introverts will always talk to you if they trust you, but not before that.
