- **Permissions** are settings within Jira that control what users can see and do, like whether users can create new projects or see a specific type of comment on an issue.
	- **Global permissions** allow Jira administrators to control functionality that is system-wide and project-independent. They are granted to groups and can only be modified by Jira administrators.
		- Example: One global permission controls whether users can see the other users in the application.
	- **Project permissions** let you restrict project related functionality to individual users, groups, or project roles. Project specific permissions can only be modified by Jira administrators.
		- Example: One project permission controls who can see the project's issues and create, edit, and assign them
