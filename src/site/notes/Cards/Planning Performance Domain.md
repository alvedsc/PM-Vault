Deals with activities and functions associated with the initial, ongoing, and evolving *organization and coordination necessary for delivering project deliverables and outcomes*.

> [!caution]
Planning is important in either predictive or adaptive approaches 

Planning aims to develop an approach to *creating the project deliverables proactively*.
- Create a method to deliver the deliverables. That is all that planning means. 

Outcomes include:
- ﻿﻿The project moves in an organized, coordinated, and *deliberate manner*.
- ﻿﻿There is a *holistic approach* to providing the project outcomes ([[Cards/PM Principle - Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions\|Systems Thinking]])
- ﻿﻿*Evolving* information is elaborated.
- ﻿﻿Time spent planning is appropriate. *Not too little or too much*.
- ﻿﻿Planning is sufficient to *manage stakeholder expectations*.
- ﻿﻿There is a *process for the adaptation of plans*.

Because each project is unique, the *volume, timing, and frequency of planning varies from project to project*.

Variables include, but are not limited to:
- ﻿﻿Development approach
- ﻿﻿Project deliverables
- ﻿﻿Organizational requirements
- ﻿﻿Market conditions: *Need to push a product out faster?* 
- ﻿﻿Legal or regulatory restrictions

# How to plan

When planning, things to consider will be:

- ﻿﻿Delivery - What is the *scope* being delivered by the project?
- ﻿﻿[[Cards/Agile Estimation\|Estimating]] - *Scope, schedule, and budget of resources*, both people and physical.
- ﻿﻿Schedules - *Models used to determine when work has to be done*
- ﻿﻿Budget- *How much work will cost*
- Resources: Planning for how the team will be made begins with *identifying the skill sets required to accomplish the project work.*
	- Physical resources apply to any resource that is not a person.
- *Communication planning overlaps with stakeholder* identification, analysis, prioritization, and engagement.
- Procurement: 
	- Procurements can happen at any time during a project.
- Change: There will be *changes* throughout the project.
- *Risks*: some changes are a result of a risk event, and others are due to customer requests or other reasons
