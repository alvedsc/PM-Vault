- Project boards are **two-dimensional to-do lists**
	- The two dimensions become more important than with a personal to do list because the work items can be in multiple states and be worked on by multiple team members.
- Project boards help **visualize a team's workflows**
	- Project boards visualize the work process of the team, and can be physical boards (such as sticky notes in columns) or digital boards (such as Jira boards).
	- On a Jira board, each issue is shown as a card, which displays a convenient subset of the issues’ fields for easy visualization.
- Project boards **display issues as cards**
	- The fields displayed on a card can be **configured to match the team’s desires.**
