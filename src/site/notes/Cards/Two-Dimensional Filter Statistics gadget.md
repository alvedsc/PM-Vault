The Two-Dimensional Filter Statistics gadget enables you to create a table by cross-indexing two data sources. For example, you can create a filter to retrieve all open issues in a particular project. You can then configure the gadget to display the statistical data on this collection of issues, in a table with configurable axes, such as Assignee versus Issue Type.
