The [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] can create **template projects** with common configurations used by your organization. Then, whenever a new project is created, it can use shared configurations based on one of these template projects.

In this way, all of the possible project configurations are known, and any changes to the template projects will automatically be propagated to all shared projects.

### Tips for template projects

When creating template projects: 

-   Try to create as few as possible. 
-   Create just enough to articulate key differences. 
-   The most significant differences are typically workflows and permissions, so consider those first.
