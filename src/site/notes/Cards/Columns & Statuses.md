- Inside the columns of a board, issues can have different statuses. 
- Moreover, when an issue is moved to a certain column, the [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]] can be set up so the issue gets a certain **status** when moved to specific columns

The colors of statuses represent **status categories**: gray for To Do, blue for In Progress, and green for Done. These help you identify where issues are in their lifecycle, like when viewing many issues on the Version Details page and Sprint Health dashboard gadget.

- To add a column, check [[Cards/Adding a column in Jira\|Adding a column in Jira]]
- To add statuses, check [[Cards/Adding statuses in Jira\|Adding statuses in Jira]]
	- What happens when you want **statuses** to be assigned based on **columns**? Check the following [[Cards/case study 1 - columns & statuses\|case study 1]]
	- Remember: each status adds more transitions and complexity. Aim for simple and scalable instead. **Whenever adding a new status to a [[Cards/Jira Workflow\|Jira Workflow]], make sure you have no other option.** With this advice on adding statuses in mind, consider the two use cases below.
		- [[Cards/case study 2 - columns & statuses\|case study 2]] - Add In Code Review status (new status justified)
		- [[Cards/case study 3 - columns & statuses\|case study 3]] - Add Failed Verification status (new status not justified)

# In brief

The general idea is that [[Cards/Jira Workflow\|workflow]]s are determined by the way the [[Cards/Jira Team member\|team member]]s work and they are the backbone of the [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]]. In a [[Cards/What is a project board\|board]], [[Cards/Jira issues\|Jira issues]] are visualized. As [[Cards/Jira issues\|issues]] move through a board in accordance to the [[Cards/Jira Workflow\|workflow]] they are assigned different statuses. Statuses are attriibutes of [[Cards/Jira issues\|Jira issues]], and they give information about the current status of the issue and help the team prioritize and so each [[Cards/Jira Team member\|team member]] determines the next task to perform.
