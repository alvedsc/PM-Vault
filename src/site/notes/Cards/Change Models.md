# [The ADKAR® Model](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar)

- ﻿﻿Step 5: Reinforcement: Rewards

# The 8-Step Process for Leading Change 

It is a *top-down approach* where the change originates at the top levels of the organization and then is promoted down through the organization. The eight steps are:

- ﻿﻿Step 1: Create urgency
- ﻿﻿Step 2: Form a powerful coalition
- ﻿﻿Step 3: Create a vision for change
	- Something that you can communicate that will make people inspired, for example.
		- It will give you raises
		- It will make processes easy.
- ﻿﻿Step 4: Communicate the vision
- ﻿﻿Step 5: Remove obstacles
- ﻿﻿Step 6: Create short-term wins
- ﻿﻿Step 7: Build on the change
	- short-term change after short-term change into a larger change
- ﻿﻿Step 8: Anchor the changes in corporate culture.

	- What change was introduced
- ﻿﻿Chaos
	- Out of the comfort zone
- ﻿﻿The transforming idea
	- The people start to develop new ways of working. Trying new things!
	- [[Sensemaking Map\|Sensemaking]] 
- ﻿﻿Practice and Integration
	- These transformative ideas are potentially scaled into the larger organization.
- ﻿﻿New status quo

The model identifies three stages of transition associated with change.
