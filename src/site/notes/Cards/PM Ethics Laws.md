- Follow the laws of the country you are in.
- ﻿﻿A national law can be tough on a project but must be followed.
- ﻿﻿Always stay respectful of another country's culture or customs.
	- Sometimes some things are not law but are traditions (religious holidays, for example). Make sure your practice honors them and doesn't put people in a position where they have to disrespect their culture and traditions.

> In the [[Cards/PMP Exam\|PMP Exam]], you'll be told that the world will end if you don't do something against the law. This is a trap question. Always respect the law in the country you are located, no matter what. Don't step over a regulation. Wait for the permit.
