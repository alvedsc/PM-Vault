## Epics

- Epics can contain other issue types like 
	- Story
	- Task
	- Bug
- Represent large issues
- Child issues in epics can span multiple iterations, projects, teams, and boards
- Can be a placeholder for many other stories. 
- As the team gets closer to epics, they can start adding child issues to increase the detail
- Epics are organized in [[Cards/Jira Roadmaps\|Roadmaps]], which work like waterfall projects in the organization for planning. 
- **An Epic cannot have another epic** [[Cards/Jira issue hierarchy\|Jira issue hierarchy]] 

## Why epics?

- Organization of work items.
- They can span multiple iterations and projects.
- Simplifies backlog.
	- because you can represent a large amount of work as one issue at first
