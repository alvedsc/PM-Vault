A customized workflow is usually a more complex workflow.

Often, it has a specific sequence of steps rather than allowing every status to transition into every other status ([[Cards/global transitions\|global transitions]]). The [[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrator]] may add **conditions, user input validation and automated functions** to transitions in the workflow. There could be **screens that pop up during transitions that allow users to enter data, for example, a resolution.**

[[Cards/Jira administrator\|Jira administrators]] are the only ones that can fully edit a [[Cards/Jira Workflow\|Jira Workflow]]; [[Cards/Jira project administrator\|project administrators]] have limited editing capability for their project workflows.
