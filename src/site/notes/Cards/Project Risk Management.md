# Risk Management Terminology

[[Cards/Risk Management Terminology\|Risk Management Terminology]]



**Risk is negative or positive.** 
- Negative risks are threats.  
- Positive risks are opportunities.
 
**Risk appetite**
- ﻿﻿Amount of risk you are willing to take for a reward
	- How willing are you to go into a casino to gamble?
﻿﻿**Risk tolerance**
- ﻿﻿Amount of volume of risk you are willing to take
	- Once you get into the casino, how much money are you willing to lose? 

**Knowledge of the risks**
- Known-Knowns, 
- Known-unknowns (You haven't analyzed them), 
- Unknown-unknowns

**Event Risk**
- Future possible events - Most identified risk
**Non-Event Risks**
- **Variability Risk**
	- *Some aspect of a planned task or situation is uncertain*. E.g., Productivity targets, errors during testing, or weather patterns.
		- You planned for something to take five days, and it takes seven. 
- **Ambiguity Risk**
	- *Uncertainties arise from a lack of knowledge or understanding*: E.g., The use of new technology or future regulations.
**Project Resilience**
- Ability to handle the risk that was not known. Ability to handle unknowable unknowns.
**Integrated risk management**
- Manage risk at the appropriate level.
	- For example, managing these two risks:
		- A coder gets sick
		- A major weather event stops a whole project operation
