**Objective**: Why do we need to verify and validate our work? 
- Gulf of Evaluation:
{ #b9b150}

	- What one person describes is often different from how another interprets it. 
- We don't want this in a professional [[Cards/Project\|project]]. Everything should be validated and verified. 

# How to perform it? 

- Resolve problems immediately (Avoid [[Cards/Waste\|Waste]]) instead of letting them grow. 

This is an example of how [[Cards/Extreme Programming\|Extreme Programming]] performs constant Verifying and Validating:
