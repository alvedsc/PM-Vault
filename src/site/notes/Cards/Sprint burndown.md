This chart aims to have all the forecasted work completed by the end of the sprint. The sprint burndown report indicates how work in a sprint is tracked against project progress at any given time. The burndown report is only helpful if an estimation metric has been used to plan the sprint.

- The y-axis represents the amount of work remaining
- The x-axis represents the time
- The blue line is the estimated work completed at any given time.
- The orange is the actual work completed at any given time. 
- The gray area is the weekend. 

# Notes

- As long as the orange line remains under the blue line, the team is on the way to finish the sprint succesfully 
- If the team repeteadly finishes early they are not committing to enough work 
- If the team repeteadly misses the forecast they are not committing to enough work 
- The burndown line makes steep drops rather than a more gradual burndown because the work hasn't been broken down into granular pieces.
