You must determine the best development approach and life cycle to deliver the work. 

This domain deals with *activities and functions. associated with the development approach, cadence, and project life cycle phases.*

> [!Note]
Delivery cadence refers to the timing and frequency of project deliverables.

Outcomes include:
- ﻿﻿Correct development approaches.
- ﻿﻿A project life cycle that connects the delivery of business and stakeholder value from the beginning to the end of the project.
- ﻿﻿A project life cycle comprises phases that facilitate the delivery cadence and development approach required to produce the project deliverables.

> [!info]
*Projects can have a single, multiple, or periodic delivery.*

# Development Approach

A development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle.
- There are different development approaches. Three common approaches include:
	- ﻿﻿Predictive approach
	- ﻿﻿Adaptive approach, including both iterative and incremental
	- ﻿﻿Hybrid approach

Several factors influence the selection of a development approach, including: 

- ﻿﻿**Product, service, or result**
	- ﻿﻿Degree of innovation: number of iterations needed
	- ﻿﻿Requirements certainty: agility needed
	- ﻿﻿Scope stability: do you know what you need at the beginning?
	- ﻿﻿Ease of change: solidity vs. fluidity
	- ﻿﻿Delivery options
	- ﻿﻿Risk
	- ﻿﻿Safety requirements: more requirements -> maybe predictive is better 
	- ﻿﻿Regulations: more regulations -> maybe predictive is better 
- ﻿﻿**The Project**
	- ﻿﻿*Stakeholders:* The right approach is the one that makes your stakeholders happy and delivers outcomes 
	- ﻿﻿Schedule constraints
	- ﻿﻿Funding availability
- ﻿﻿**Organization**
	- ﻿﻿Organizational structure
	- ﻿﻿Culture: Maybe the organization has regulations on the type of projects you do 
	- ﻿﻿Organizational capability
	- ﻿﻿Project team size and location

# Life Cycle

The things we go through to build the deliverable. The type and number of phases in a project life cycle rest upon many things. One example of a life cycle can be:

> [!Note]
The PM and the team determine life cycles.
