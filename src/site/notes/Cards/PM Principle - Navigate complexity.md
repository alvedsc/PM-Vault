Complexity is the outcome of 
- Human behavior: Your team does not get along
- System interactions: X does not work with Y
- uncertainty, and ambiguity 
- technological innovation

Complexity can arise at any point during the project.
- **Constantly** evaluate and navigate project complexity so that approaches and plans enable the project team to navigate the entire project successfully.
- Complexity can be introduced by *events or conditions*

Project teams can *stay vigilant* in identifying elements of complexity and use various methods to reduce the impact of complexity.
- Project teams often cannot forecast complexity emerging because it results from *many conditions and events*.
- *Being vigilant* for indications of complexity allows project teams to adapt their approaches and plans to navigate potential disruption to effective project delivery.
