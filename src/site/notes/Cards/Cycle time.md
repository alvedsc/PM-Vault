**Cycle time is the time issues spend on work stages, cycles, or phases until they are done**. A measure of *how long it takes to get things done.* 

> [!important]
> This is in contrast to [[Cards/Lead Time\|Lead Time]] which is the time it takes to go through the totality of the process. [[Cards/Cycle time\|Cycle time]] is a part of [[Cards/Lead Time\|Lead Time]].  

[[Cards/Cycle time\|Cycle time]] is associated with [[Cards/Work in Progress\|Work in Progress]]. 

$$\text { Cycle Time }=\frac{W I P}{\text { Throughput }}$$

**Throughput**: Amount of work that can be done in a time period. 

> [!Note] Example of Cycle Time calculation
> What would be the cycle time of feature A, if it requires 60 points of work and the team can complete 5 points per day?
> 
> =60/5 points per day = 12 days.
