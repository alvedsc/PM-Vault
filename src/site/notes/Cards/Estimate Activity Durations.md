- ﻿﻿Estimating the periods needed to complete individual activities with estimated resources.

		- [[Cards/Scope\|scope]] of work, 
		- required resource types or skill levels, 
			- estimated resource quantities, and 
			- resource calendars (availability).

> Estimation should be done after knowing about the work, who is assigned, what resources are assigned to it, etc

> [!tip]
> The duration of an activity will depend on the quality and quantity of resources assigned to it and their availability.
