## Define Scrum

- Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering and sustaining complex projects. 
- It is another way to implement Agility, just like Kanban

- It starts with a vision, hopefuly the best vision possible 
- Then it incrementally approaches the vision in an iterative way
	- Every iteration the vision changes as more is known from the customer
	- The actual product is worked on in  each iteration to look more and more like the vision 
	- ![Scrum Overview I - Artifacts.05-05-2023-1.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Scrum%20Overview%20I%20-%20Artifacts.05-05-2023-1.png)
- The **increment** is a usable product that is possible to give it to the customer
	- Not necessarily given to them, but it is potentially usable. 
	- Meets the organization's "Definition of Done" (DOD)
	- Contains the work of current and previous iterations
- The **Sprint** Time-box used to work on an product increment
	- 1 - 4 weeks long, but typically 2 weeks 

### Parts of the Scrum framework
- This is not in accordance to Scrum Alliance but
	- Artifacts: Product backlog, sprint backlog, sprint goal, sprint board, reports (some of these are artifacts but not from Scrum)
	- Roles: Product owner, scrum master, development team members (devs), stakeholders
	- Events: sprint, sprint planning, daily standups, sprint review, sprint retrospective 

## Scrum artifacts

Artifacts help the team be more effective by providing transparency 
![Scrum Overview I - Artifacts.05-05-2023-2.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Scrum%20Overview%20I%20-%20Artifacts.05-05-2023-2.png)

### Product backlog
- Ordered, ever-changing todo list of the project 
- Can include features, improvements, bug fixes
- check [[Certified Scrum Master#Scrum artifacts\|Certified Scrum Master#Scrum artifacts]]
- Modifying the PB is called PB Refinement

#### Creating a sprint in Jira
- In the Backlog page, click "Create Sprint" button 
- This creates a pane for the sprint, and there you can drag issues from the backlog to the pane
- ![Scrum Overview I - Artifacts.05-05-2023-3.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Scrum%20Overview%20I%20-%20Artifacts.05-05-2023-3.png)

### Sprint backlog 
- Subset of PB
- List of features to be completed in the sprint
- Includes plan on how to accomplish work on these issues 
- Can fully emerge during the sprint 

#### Estimation - story points

- The sprint is planned during the sprint planning event 
- However, sprint planning is an activity so the sprint is always reviewed
- **Story points** are a relative measure of the amount of effort requiret to complete a story 
- This is used to determine how many stories to complete in a sprint

#### Starting the sprint 

- Once you are ready to start, click the "Start sprint" button. 
- Add the details 
- Sprint goal: Objective of the increment
	- reached by completing the sprint backlog
	- the goal does not change during the sprint (Protect the goal at all costs)
	- The sprint is a success if the sprint goal is reached 
	- Why?
		- Provides coherenve of the increment 
		- gives flexibility to the how, so the why remains constant 

### Sprint board 
- it is a kanban but with only items from the sprint backlog 

### Scrum reports
- Burndown chart: Measuring the completion of story points per date
	- ![Scrum Overview I - Artifacts.05-05-2023-5.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Scrum%20Overview%20I%20-%20Artifacts.05-05-2023-5.png)
	- Here the grey lines show a linear decrease (without the days off (dark grey)) would look like
	- The red lines show the actual work done 
	- 
- Sprint report:
	- Contains a Burndown chart and a list of issues and their current status (not completed) 
- Velocity chart
	- Velocity: Total sprint points per sprint divided by time
	- Comparison of estimation and actual sprint points burnt 
	- ![Scrum Overview I - Artifacts.05-05-2023-6.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Scrum%20Overview%20I%20-%20Artifacts.05-05-2023-6.png)
