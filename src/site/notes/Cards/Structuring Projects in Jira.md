When creating and configuring projects for your teams, a key factor is deciding how many projects to create. Can multiple teams share a project, or is it better to create individual projects for each team?

### TEAMS SHARE A SINGLE PROJECT

A shared project is a good choice when:

-   All teams are working from the same roadmap
-   All teams contribute to coordinated product releases
-   A common set of permissions is sufficient for all teams
-   A common workflow is sufficient for all teams
-   Significant portion of work output shared by multiple teams (e.g., core API libraries, etc.)
-   Single-project sprint planning
-   Shared reporting and metrics are sufficient


### A PROJECT FOR EACH TEAM

 Individual projects are a good choice when:

-   Teams work from independent roadmaps
-   Releases are not coordinated between teams
-   Different permission configurations required for each team
-   Specialized workflows required for individual teams
-   Each team’s primary work is proprietary to the team (e.g., independent products for different platforms)
-   Sprint planning isn’t coordinated among teams
-   Individual reporting and metrics are needed
