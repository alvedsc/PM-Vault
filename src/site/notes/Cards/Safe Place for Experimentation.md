Team members will always have good ideas to do things better. However, they will resist implementing them because, if they fail, they'll have consequences. 

Establish a safe environment for experimentation. 
- This allows team members to build a *strong commitment to decisions*.
- Encourage people to *experiment with new methods*.
	- This leads to 
		- More engagement.
		- Product improvements.
