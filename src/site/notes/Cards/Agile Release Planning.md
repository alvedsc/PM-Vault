Meeting with **all [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]]** to determine which [[Cards/User Stories\|User Stories]] will be done in which [[Cards/Sprint\|Iteration]] for the upcoming [[Cards/Release\|release]].

How to select the [[Cards/User Stories\|user stories]] for the [[Cards/Release\|release]]?
- Using [[Cards/Team Velocity\|Team Velocity]] - points per iteration.

Slicing the stories.
- Breaking down stories that are too large to be completed in one iteration

> [!attention] Example of a big story that needs slicing
> *As an accounts receivable user, I want to be able to enter all my invoices so I can build customer profiles and get paid.* 
> 
> This user story probably corresponds to an entire section of accounts receivable. The resulting slicing would look like this:
> 
> - *As an accounts receivable user, I would like to input a list of our customers so I can see our current customers* 
> - *As an accounts receivable user, I would like to generate an invoice so I can tell the customer how much they owe us*

# Contrasting to [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]] 

The [[schedule\|schedule]] will be broken up into smaller iterations versus a traditional project where the [[schedule\|schedule]] is for the entire [[Cards/Project\|project]].
- Smaller increments allow the customers an opportunity to give feedback on the product with a quicker turnaround.
- In this case, we must devise [[Cards/Release\|release]] schedules, knowing how many iterations come before each release, with specific dates.
