# Attributes of the Product Backlog

- **Appropriately detailed**
	- Team members can easily understand upcoming [[Cards/Product Backlog Items\|Product Backlog Items]] without being overly detailed. [Alistair Cockburn describes](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/extreme-programming-installed/0201708426/0201708426_ch04lev1sec3.html) backlog items as tokens promising a future conversation.  
- **Emergent**
	- A product backlog should evolve, adding new items as we learn more about the problem space.
- **[[Cards/Agile Estimation\|Estimated]]**
	- A product backlog is a planning tool that helps organize development resources available. Therefore, each upcoming item should have an estimate of how long it will take to complete
- **Ordered**: 
	- Sequential but *not necessarily by Priority or Value* because some [[Cards/Product Backlog Items\|PBIs]] might be less important but still necessary to do first. (Check [[Cards/Value-Based Prioritization\|Value-Based Prioritization]])

> [!Note]
> Giving attributes to [[Cards/Product Backlog Items\|Product Backlog Items]] is called [[Cards/Backlog Refinement\|Backlog Refinement]].
