PMBOK: **Inputs, Tools/Techniques, and Outputs (ITTO) combined to execute a specific purpose of the project**

# ITTOs

- Input
	- Starting point for the process, the raw materials to begin the execution
		- Could be the output of a previous process
- Tools and Techniques
	- The actions or methods that are used to transform the raw materials into the output
- Output
	- The end result of our efforts. The raw materials into a polished stone
		- Maybe the input into another process

# Why Processes?

- We do processes because we want certain output
