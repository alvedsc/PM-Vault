- ﻿﻿Escalate: Outside the Project Team Level.
	-  Deregulation happens, and you let the legal department handle it. 

- ﻿Exploit: Remove any and all uncertainty.
	- Make sure the opportunity takes place. 

> [!important]- Example of Exploit
> A client offers an incentive if you finish the project two months ahead. In [[Cards/Plan Risk Responses\|response]], you offer all possible incentives and hire more personnel to **ensure** you do it on time.
> > [!caution]
> There might still be new risks associated with an exploitation strategy. In the example above, having more employees increases the risk of someone having an accident. Make sure you have appropriate strategies in these cases. 

- ﻿﻿Share: Some or all ownership to a 3rd party.

> [!important]- Example of Share
> A joint venture

- Enhance: Increase the probability or impact of the event happening.

> [!important]- Example of Enhance
> Instead of doing anything and everything to ensure you will realize the risk, like in the case of Exploit, you increase its likelihood. If a client offers a bonus for finishing two months earlier, you start earlier or hire more people. 

- Accept: Take advantage of the opportunity, but do not seek it.
