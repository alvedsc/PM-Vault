Any user can create a board. There are two ways to create a board:
- Boards are created with **new projects** and can reference **existing projects** (if you're a Jira admin). This is what was observed in [[Cards/Board & project relationships\|Board & project relationships]]. 
- Boards can also be based on an **existing filter query**, copy an **existing board** or use a [[Cards/Kanban sub-filter\|Kanban sub-filter]] (Only for [[Cards/Kanban\|kanban]]). More on this at [[Cards/Other board creation methods\|Other board creation methods]]
