A method to flatten the schedule when resources are [[Cards/Over-allocated resource\|over-allocated]] or allocated unevenly.

- ﻿﻿Resource leveling: start and finish dates are adjusted based on [[Cards/resources\|Resources]] [[Cards/Constraints\|Constraints]] to balance resource demand. 
	- The problem is that you are adjusting the [[schedule\|schedule]] based on your [[Cards/resources\|Resources]] [[Cards/Constraints\|Constraints]]. 
	- This will increase your [[Cards/Critical Path Method\|Critical Path]] 
- ﻿﻿Resource Smoothing: adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. It may not change the critical path.
	- You build the [[schedule\|schedule]] with [[Cards/resources\|Resources]]. That way, the [[Cards/Critical Path Method\|Critical Path]] does not need to be readjusted.
