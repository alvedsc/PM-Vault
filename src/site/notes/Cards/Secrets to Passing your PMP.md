There are more things to pass the exam, other than studying 

Secrets
- **Understand the concepts, don’t memorize them**
	- Do I know how/where to use this
	- Don’t memorize
		- There are things to memorize, like formulas, but you can’t possibly memorize all of it 
		- They won’t ask your what is an output or input of a process, but they will give you scenarios and you’ll have to know the best possible thing to do 
	- For example:
		- They give you a scenario and ask you what are the best tools to collect requirements 
		- If you don’t know how/when/where to use the tools, you will have no idea how to answer this 
- **Do not apply your work experience**
	- The more experience you have, the more likely you are going to fail
	- Be an empty cup
- **Apply the [[PMI Project Manager Mindset\|PMI Project Manager Mindset]]**
	- This is what a PMP would think
