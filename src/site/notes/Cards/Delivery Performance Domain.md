The [[Cards/Work Performance Domain\|Work Performance Domain]] is all about managing the work. Making sure the work is being done. The items in the [[Cards/Create WBS\|WBS]] are checked. 

In this domain, you check whether the *objectives and goals were fulfilled*. It deals with activities and functions associated with *delivering the scope and quality* that the project was undertaken to achieve.

Outcomes include:
- ﻿﻿Projects contribute to *business objectives*.
- ﻿﻿Projects realize the *outcomes*.
- ﻿﻿Project *benefits are realized in the time frame*.
- ﻿﻿The project team has an *understanding of the requirements*.
- ﻿﻿*Stakeholders accept and are satisfied with project deliverables*.

> [!Note]
Project *delivery is about meeting requirements, scope, and quality expectations* to produce the expected deliverable.

> [!attention]
Some projects deliver value throughout, and others deliver the bulk at the end.

The project manager must understand how the deliverable can deliver value to the stakeholders. This includes:
- ﻿﻿Requirements gathering.
- ﻿﻿Evolving and discovering requirements
- ﻿﻿Managing [[Cards/Requirements\|Requirements]]
- ﻿﻿Define and decompose the scope.
- ﻿﻿Completion of deliverables
# Quality

Quality requirements can be reflected in the *completion criteria, the definition of done, the statement of work, or requirements documentation.*

The project manager must consider the following of quality:
- ﻿﻿[Cost of Quality](https://asq.org/quality-resources/cost-of-quality#:~:text=Appraisal%20costs%20are%20associated%20with,that%20they%20conform%20to%20specifications.)
	- ﻿﻿Prevention.
	- ﻿﻿Appraisal.
	- ﻿﻿Internal Failure.
	- ﻿﻿External Failure.
- ﻿﻿Cost of Change: The more underwent the project, the higher the cost of changes

If you are in a predictive environment and you have many changes, maybe it means the team does not understand what they are doing.
