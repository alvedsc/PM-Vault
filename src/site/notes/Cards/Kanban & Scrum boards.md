Jira offers two types of boards to track issues: Kanban boards and Scrum boards. 
- [[Cards/Kanban\|kanban boards]] are excellent for tracking an ongoing stream of tasks, such as support issues or bug fixes.  
	- By default the leftmost column of a Kanban board serves as a backlog, but a dedicated backlog page can be enabled, if desired.
- [[Cards/Scrum\|scrum boards]] are ideal for teams working in small cycles, or sprints. 
	- Scrum boards have a dedicated backlog where work can be planned and allocated to sprints, Scrum boards are sometimes referred to as "sprint boards" or "agile boards".

>[!info]
>**Scrum and Kanban are not mutually exclusive. Many teams like to use both of them, applying the correct tool for a given task.**
