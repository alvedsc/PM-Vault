> Principles can, but do not necessarily, reflect morals. *A code of ethics is related to morals*.

A code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession to establish **expectations for moral conduct**. PMI is based on four values:
- ﻿﻿Responsibility
- ﻿﻿Respect
- ﻿﻿Fairness
- ﻿﻿Honesty
