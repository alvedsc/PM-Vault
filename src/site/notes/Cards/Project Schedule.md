The project schedule may be a high-level document or as detailed as having each activity [[Cards/resources\|Resources]] assigned. 
It features:
- Project start and end date. 
- Each activity's start & end date.

Most often shown as a graphical presentation. 
- [[Cards/Project Schedule Network Diagram\|Project Schedule Network Diagram]] 
- [[Cards/Gantt Chart\|Bar charts]] (normally a [[Cards/Gantt Chart\|Gantt Chart]])
- [[Cards/Milestone Chart\|Milestone Chart]]

> [!important]
> The [[Cards/Schedule Baseline\|Schedule Baseline]] is part of the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]. The [[Cards/Project Schedule\|Project Schedule]] is **not** part of the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]. The reason is that the [[Cards/Project Schedule\|Project Schedule]] is much more detailed. To change elements in the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]] you need a [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]], and doing this for every schedule change can be too much.
