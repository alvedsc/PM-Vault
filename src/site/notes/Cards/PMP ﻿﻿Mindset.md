# [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]] Mindset

When wondering between several good answers, look for which one is the one that works in most cases. This makes it potentially the most generalized one. 
- For example, if you are wondering between extending the schedule or implementing a risk response, choose risk response since the risk response was made with the possibility of a schedule extension, but after doing a risk assessment process, which you have not performed to come up with the schedule extension solution. 

"Seeking guidance" or anything similar is usually not a good answer.

Make sure you check for something along the lines of "You have just been assigned to an (ongoing) project." In this case, you know none of the [[Cards/Project Plans\|project plans]], so reviewing them might be appropriate

[[Cards/Project Stakeholder Management\|Stakeholder Management]] 
- Identifying and analyzing [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]] throughout the project, not just at the beginning.
	- [[Cards/Identify Stakeholders\|Identify Stakeholders]] is done continuously to determine their needs, [[Cards/Requirements\|Requirements]], and [[Cards/Project Stakeholder Management\|Engagement]] strategies. 
	- ﻿﻿Use inclusive tools like a whiteboard with a marker versus complex software.
- Engage [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholders]] often and regularly. Use meetings, one-on-one conversations, phone calls, and presentations to engage them.
	- When they are still not engaged, they need you to deliver the project in increments.
- 

[[Cards/Change Management Plan\|Change Management]] 
- ﻿﻿Always follow a plan and never allow changes to the plan without an approved [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]] (by the [[Cards/Change Control Board\|Change Control Board]]).
	- ﻿﻿Any [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholder]] wanting to change any project management plan component must submit a [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]].
	- ﻿﻿All [[Cards/Change Requests\|change requests]] will need to be *reviewed and assessed before taking action*. 
		- To assess a change, you need to use inclusive processes for all [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] 
		- Make sure you pay attention to the wording. **Review** implies checking, while **update** implies approving a [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]], which you are not authorized to do.  

[[Cards/Decision-Making\|Decision-Making]] 
- Never take any action without first creating a plan.
	- "Plan" here doesn't mean [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]]. It means a "Strategy." 
		- This implies *involving relevant [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] or Team members.* 
		- ﻿﻿Consult with the project [[Cards/Team Performance Domain\|Team]] before making decisions, as they will have a more practical approach since they will implement said solution.
			- The team is the [[Cards/Expert Judgment\|Subject Matter Expert]].
- ﻿﻿Your final decision should always benefit the objectives of the project. 
	- For example, if there are conflicting methods to complete a task, choose the method to deliver the most value to the project.
	- *If your PM plan does not comply with legal requirements, you **must** change the plan.* 

[[Cards/Project Integration Management\|Project Integration Management]] 
- Your main job is to be an integrator of the many different components within a project. Do not concentrate your time and efforts on one thing while ignoring others.
- All scope [[Cards/Change Requests\|Changes]] should be assessed on how they will impact all other project parts.
	- This includes: 
		- Schedule
		- Cost
		- Quality -> New scope, new quality requirements.
		- Resources -> Do we have what we need to deliver the new requirements

- ﻿﻿Projects that are terminated early still need to be closed formally through the close project or phase process.

[[Cards/Scope Management Plan\|Scope Management Plan]] 
- The best people to [[Cards/WBS\|break down work]] is the project team.
- The customers are the best people to check a [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverable]] for scope conformance and quality requirements being met as they are the ones that will use the product.
- ﻿﻿Quality requirements should be defined early in the project and be checked often to ensure they're getting done.
	- These are part of [[Cards/Project Scope Management\|Project Scope Management]] in [[Cards/Collect Requirements\|Collect Requirements]], but quality assurance and control are part of [[Cards/Project Quality Management\|Project Quality Management]]. 
	- When they talk about *functionality*, they mean Quality, not Scope. 

[[Cards/Project Communications Management\|Project Communications Management]]

[[Cards/Project Risk Management\|Project Risk Management]] 
- [[Cards/Identify Risks\|Identify]] as much risk as possible as *early* as possible on a project. All [[Cards/Risk Register\|identified risks]] should be documented in the [[Cards/Risk Register\|risk register]] *with corresponding responses.*
	- **Always** make a plan with Risk Assessment whenever a new risk is identified. 
	- Look for conditional words like (may, might). These imply uncertainty and, thus, potential risk. *==If there is no uncertainty, it is not a risk==*
- A negative risk is known as a threat, while a positive risk is known as an opportunity. Ensure to identify and document responses to both.

[[Cards/Project Procurement Management\|Project Procurement Management]]

- ﻿﻿Any problem that occurs on a project should be resolved by the [[Cards/Development Team\|Agile Project Team]].

	- ﻿﻿Utilize feedback loops. Feedback loops occur when you've completed the task and then take what you've learned from that and input the lessons learned into your next task.
