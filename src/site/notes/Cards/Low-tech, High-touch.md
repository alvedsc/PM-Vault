These are features of [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]] processes, tools, methods,[[Cards/Team Spaces\|Team Spaces]], etc; that are preferable over highly technical alternatives:
- ﻿﻿Whiteboards and task boards
- ﻿﻿Sticky notes, flip charts
- ﻿﻿Round table
- ﻿﻿No barriers to face-to-face communication

Some advantage is that these are more [[Cards/Effective Communication Channels\|Effective Communication Channels]]. They are also always there, so they work as [[Cards/Information Radiators\|Information Radiators]]. Finally, the power can shut down and they still work.
