These charts tell you if a process is under **control**
- Identify the Rule of Seven

![Control Charts.16-06-2023.png](/img/user/Extras/Images/Control%20Charts.16-06-2023.png)
- **Mean**: The dotted line is the mean (Average) of all the data points in the chart. 
- **Rule of Seven**: Seven or more points on one side of the dotted line means that something is going on with the process 
- **Control Limits**: The threshold of what is acceptable
	- For example, a door can't be higher than six feet because the frame is six feet long. This would be an Upper Control Limit. 
	- Anything above or below the control limits is called a **Defect**. 
		- This is a trigger for [[Cards/Process Improvement Plan\|Process Improvement]] 

> [!Attention]
> If you see a Rule of Seven: You inspect the process 
> If you see a Defect: You fix the process
