Bugs are defects that impair the functioning of the product. Jira Software also provides a dedicated bug-tracking project template that can be selected when creating new projects. The bug tracking project does not include a board by default, but a board can always be added to a bug tracking project.

Examples:

-   App crashes when user submits empty address field
-   Graphic glitches on preferences page
-   Broken links on help page
