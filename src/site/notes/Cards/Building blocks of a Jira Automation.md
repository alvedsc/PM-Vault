There are three main components of an automation in Jira:
- [[Cards/Trigger (When)\|Trigger (When)]]
- [[Cards/Conditions (If)\|Conditions (If)]]
- [[Cards/Actions (Then)\|Actions (Then)]]

When configuring automation rules, it's possible to create aÂ **branch**: a separate section of the rule and perform actions on related issues. For more information, visit [Jira Automation Branches](https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-automation-branches/)
