#Incomplete 
> [!caution] Mistake with [[Cards/Development Approach\|Development Approach]]
> There is an error here. This document does not describe [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Project Life Cycle Description]], but the [[Cards/Development Approach\|Development Approach]]. However, many references throughout the vault reference the [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Project Life Cycle Description]] that should be discussing [[Cards/Development Approach\|Development Approach]]. Before changing the content of this note, I need to fix all the references. The error is the following: 
> 
> **Development Approach.** A method used to create and evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle, such as a predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid method _(PMBOK® Guide_, 7th Edition, page 239).
> 
> **Project Life Cycle.** The series of phases that a project passes through from its start to completion _(PMBOK® Guide_, 7th Edition, page 245).
  
  - A representation of the [[Cards/Phases\|phases]] that a [[Cards/Project\|project]] typically goes through from start to finish
	- generally sequential and sometimes overlapping [[Cards/Phases\|Phases]] 
- It can be either **predictive or adaptive**.

There are four [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Life Cycles:]] 
- Predictive
- Iterative
- Incremental 
- Agile

Some projects will follow one of these [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Life Cycles]] throughout the project life, while others will follow more than one. Here are the characteristics of each:

*Important things to notice from this chart:* 
- Predictive, Iterative, and Agile all have Dynamic requirements. This is the reason they are normally put in the same basket. 
- Iterative [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Project Life Cycle Description]] still aims to deliver one single product. This is because of the product's characteristics, it can't be delivered incrementally. An example of this is compliance software. 
- The difference between Agile and Incremental is that for the incremental Life cycle, it is expected that the process to produce an increment's deliverable is performed once. On the other hand, Agile and Iterative will repeat this process as many times as necessary until the customer is happy.
