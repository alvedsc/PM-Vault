Some permissions are dependent upon others to ensure that users can perform the actions needed. Here are several examples.

- To **resolve an issue** a user must have the Transition issue and Resolve issue permissions.
- To **move issues between projects** a user must have the Move issues permission in the source project and the Create issues permission in the target project.
- To **edit the Due Date field** a user must have the Edit issues and Schedule issues permissions.
