- ﻿﻿Sources of Conflict

	- Also team members
		- Disagreements can be over ways of doing things. 


| Conflict Resolution           | Quick Example                                                                                                    |

| [[Cards/Problem-Solving\|Problem-Solving]] (confronting) | Let's put our heads together, study the problem and find the best solution. Win-Win                              |
| Forcing                       | Bob's got priority here, so we'll agree on his solution. Win-Lose                                  |
| Compromising                  | Let's take a little of both sides of the argument and create a mixed solution. Lose-Lose                        |
| Smoothing                     | It's not that big of a problem. It can be considered a Lose-Lose                                             |
| Withdrawal                    | I'm leaving. Do whatever solution works. The conflict is not resolved. Yield-Lose solution |

# Levels of Conflict

- ﻿﻿Level 1: Problem to solve - Sharing info
	- Here's how I would do 
- ﻿﻿Level 2: Disagreement - Personal Protection
	- I think my way is better.
- ﻿﻿Level 3: Contest - Must win
	- No longer about what's best for the project
- ﻿﻿Level 4: Crusade - Protecting one's group
	- Here's probably already not possible to solve it. 
- ﻿﻿Level 5: World War - Must destroy the other
