There are two main ways to share configurations between projects:
- [[Cards/Schemes\|Schemes]]
- [[Cards/Template projects\|Template projects]]

Jira will **not** copy the below configurations if users created a project using the **shared configuration option**. These configurations are associated with a single Jira project and cannot be shared across other projects:

- Components  
- Version  
- Project role members  
- Project avatar  
- Project description  
- Project URL (From Details page)
