A sprint goal is a concise statement (between one and two sentences) outlining the objective of the [[Cards/Sprint\|sprint]]. It lets everyone in the [[Cards/Scrum Team\|Scrum Team]] know what should be accomplished during the [[Cards/Sprint\|sprint]] and should supply the motivation for the [[Cards/Sprint\|sprint]]. 

The objective of the [[Cards/Sprint\|sprint]] is to deliver a [[Cards/Product Increment\|Potentially Shippable Product]], which means this product meets the [[Cards/Definition of Done\|Definition of Done]]. 

The [[Cards/Product Owner\|product owner]] and the [[Cards/Development Team\|Development Team]] should agree upon the [[Cards/Sprint Goal\|sprint goal]]. Both parties should believe in this shared goal and maintain that it is beneficial to strive towards this goal, as it is in the service of the [[Cards/Product Goal\|Product Goal]].  

> [!attention]
> The [[Cards/Sprint Goal\|Sprint Goal]] stays the same during a [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]]. In fact, an obsolete [[Cards/Sprint Goal\|Sprint Goal]] is one of the few instances in which the [[Cards/Product Owner\|Product Owner]] cancels a [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]]
