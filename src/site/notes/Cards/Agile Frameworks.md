# A framework is different from a methodology.

- **Methodology**
	- A set of principles, tools, and practices to achieve a goal
	- Prescriptive
	- Tells us what steps to take, in what order, and how to perform them
	- Examples:
		- [[Cards/Extreme Programming\|Extreme Programming]] 
		- [[Prince2\|Prince2]]

- **Framework**
	- A loose structure that leaves room for other practices and tools to be included
	- A framework considers empirical findings.
	- Allows teams to choose their own technical processes, development roles, etc.
	- Examples:
		- [[Cards/PMBOK Guide - 6th Edition\|PMBOK Guide - 6th Edition]] 
		- [[Cards/Scrum\|Scrum]]
