A record of all the issues/problems you have encountered on the project
- All **issues are described, assigned, prioritized, and addressed.**
	- This includes issues encountered with vendors, like delays.

It is recommendable not to remove any documented issues once they are solved. Documented issues (solved or unsolved) provide a good reference for other project management activities like communication, stakeholder engagement, or documenting lessons learned.
