A complete list of all scheduled [[Cards/Activities (TPM)\|Activities (TPM)]] required for the project.
- ﻿﻿It should *include a sufficient work description as well as an activity identifier*. This is recommended so all stakeholders understand all work needed on the project.

 [[Cards/Activities (TPM)\|Activities]] are focused on the work needed to complete the [[Cards/Work Packages\|work packages]].
- They are schedule-focused, not [[Cards/WBS\|WBS]]-focused.
- Each activity should *map back to one and only one [[Cards/Work Packages\|work package]].*

> [!Note]
> [[Cards/Work Packages\|Work packages]] are [[Cards/Scope\|Scope]] determined [[Cards/Deliverables\|deliverables]], so they are not meant as a scheduling tool.
