Amount of money worth of *work that has been done* on the project.
$$EV = Actual \space\%\space Complete \space \cdot BAC$$
First, you must obtain the [[Cards/Budget at Completion\|BAC]] from the [[Cards/Cost Baseline\|Cost Baseline]]. Second, measure how much work has been finished so far ($Actual \space\%\space Complete$). This is the number of [[Cards/Work Packages\|Work Packages]] completed so far. Check the [[Cards/Work Performance Data\|Work Performance Data]] to extract the state of completion of the [[Cards/Work Packages\|Work Packages]] in the [[Cards/WBS\|WBS]]. 

Assuming the project has four [[Cards/Work Packages\|Work Packages]] and that, according to the [[Cards/Work Performance Data\|Work Performance Data]], three have been finished so far, this means 
$$Actual \space\%\space Complete = \dfrac{3}{4}=0.75 = 75\%$$
