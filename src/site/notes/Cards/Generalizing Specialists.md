These are team members that can *perform many different tasks but are skilled in certain areas (more than one) more than the rest*. These are neither generalists nor specialists but something in between.

Specialists are a problem for a [[Cards/Development Team\|Development Team]] because they are the only ones who can perform their tasks. If they can't finish the task on time, they become a bottleneck for the entire delivery pipeline. Nobody can help them, and they can help nobody.
