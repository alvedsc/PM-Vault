Organizations do projects because they want to change their current state. They need to do this to stay relevant. Remaining relevant in today's business environment is a fundamental challenge for all organizations.

Prepare those impacted for the acceptance to go from the current state to the intended future state created by the project output.

A *structured approach will help individuals, groups, and the organization transition from the current state to a future desired state.*

Change can originate *from internal influences or external sources.*

Enabling change can be challenging as *not all stakeholders embrace change.*

> [!caution]
Attempting too much change quickly can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.

> [!Note]
**Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.** *Knowing and addressing the needs of stakeholders and explaining the need for change to help them embrace change throughout the project life cycle helps to integrate the resulting change in the project work, making a successful outcome more likely.*
