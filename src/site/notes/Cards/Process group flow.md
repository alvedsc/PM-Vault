Every project has [[Cards/Phases\|Phases]]. Each [[Cards/Phases\|phase]] has the entirety of [[Cards/Process Groups & Knowledge Areas Table\|Process Groups & Knowledge Areas]] within them.  

For example, you are managing a project to build a computer program. This project has a design [[Cards/Phases\|phase]], which must have its own [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]] and go through all process groups from [[Cards/Initiating\|Initiating]] to [[Cards/Closing\|Closing]], including all 49 [[Cards/Processes\|Processes]]. This is also the case for all the other [[Cards/Phases\|Phases]] in the project.
