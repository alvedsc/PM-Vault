Stories are typically used to express a high-level feature or goal from the userâ€™s perspective, using non-technical language. They can articulate how a piece of work will deliver value to the user.

Examples:

-   Provide user help on every screen
-   Display content in both portrait and landscape views for mobile users
-   Users need to be able to undo selections on the settings screen
