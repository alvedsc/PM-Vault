- **Objective:** ﻿﻿*Translating the [[Cards/Quality Management Plan\|quality management plan]] into executable quality activities*
	- ﻿﻿It increases the probability of meeting the quality objectives and **identifying ineffective processes and causes of poor quality**.
	- ﻿﻿**Implementations of the plans** by the [[Cards/Role of the Project Manager\|Project Manager]], the [[Cards/Project Management Team\|Project Management Team]], and management to ensure the deliverables meet the quality specifications in the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|project management plan]].
	- This process confirms the **quality processes** used are meeting the quality objectives.

In previous versions of PMBOK, this process used to be called Quality Assurance. However, [[Cards/Manage Quality\|Manage Quality]] encompasses more than just Quality Assurance. It includes Quality [[Cards/Activity List\|activities]] and process improvement. 

> [!attention]
> This process is about process improvement. When it comes to observing the quality of the deliverable, that's the role of [[Cards/Control Quality\|Control Quality]]
