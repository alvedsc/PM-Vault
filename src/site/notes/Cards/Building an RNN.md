Objective: to process an input sequence and give an output sequence using [[Artificial Intelligence\|Artificial Intelligence]] algorithms learned through [[Cards/Machine Learning\|Machine Learning]]. These sequences do not have a set number of elements per input or output so [[Convolutional Neural Networks\|Convolutional Neural Networks]]  or [[Fully Connected\|Fully Connected]] networks can't be used

The process consists of:
