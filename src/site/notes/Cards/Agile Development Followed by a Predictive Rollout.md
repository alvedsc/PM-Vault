- Design and Develop have a marked [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]] approach with all the [[Cards/Scrum Artifacts\|Scrum Artifacts]], [[Cards/Scrum Events\|Scrum Events]], and [[Cards/Scrum Roles\|Scrum Roles]].  Testing also falls into this approach because testing and developing happen simultaneously throughout each [[Cards/Sprint\|Sprint]] through practices like [[Cards/XP Pair Programming\|XP Pair Programming]], [[Cards/XP Continuous Integration\|XP Continuous Integration]], [[Cards/XP Test-Driven Development\|XP Test-Driven Development]], etc.   
- Rollout follows a predictive approach because the installers (network, server, support technicians, etc.) have predetermined and well-defined processes to perform their activities, and they don't even need customer feedback. This phase would follow the [[Cards/Process Groups\|Process Groups]] stages in a [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]] style. This happens after every [[Cards/Release\|Release]] from the [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile]] [[Cards/Project Life Cycle Description\|Project Life Cycle Description]].
