- ﻿﻿[[﻿﻿Change Control Board\|﻿﻿Change Control Board]] reviews all [[Cards/Change Requests\|change requests]], approves changes, and manages changes to 
	- [[Cards/Deliverables\|Deliverables]], 
	- [[Cards/Project Documents\|Project Documents]], and 
	- The [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]] 

> [!Note]
> This process is where all change requests come to obtain a resolution

- Here you ask, "How does this affect the project?"
	- This means you need to place the change in the context of the [[Cards/Project Plans\|Project Plans]] 
		- How much will this change cost?
		- How much will it delay the project? 

- ﻿﻿Communicating the decisions.
- ﻿﻿The process where you *assess the change's impact* on the project
- ﻿﻿*The [[Cards/Role of the Project Manager\|PM]] is ultimately responsible for all changes*.
- ﻿﻿Any [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholder]] may request a change.
	- ﻿﻿Should be submitted in *written form*

> Changes are difficult to implement. It is sometimes complicated for the [[Project Team\|Project Team]] or other [[Cards/Stakeholders\|Stakeholders]] to adapt to the change. As a response, the [[Cards/PMBOK Guide - 7th Edition\|PMBOK Guide - 7th Edition]] introduced the concept of [[Cards/Change Models\|Change Models]].

# Process for making a change

1. A [[Cards/Stakeholders\|stakeholder]] identifies a need for a [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]]
2. A written [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]] is submitted to the Project Manager
3. The Project Manager **assesses the impact** of the [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]] and looks for options for the [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change]] to happen. 
	1. Modifying the [[schedule\|schedule]], [[Cards/Scope\|scope]], [[cost\|cost]], etc.
4. The [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]] is submitted to the [[Cards/Change Control Board\|Change Control Board]]
5. The [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]] is either approved or rejected by the [[Cards/Change Control Board\|Change Control Board]]. This triggers a change in the [[Cards/Change Log\|Change Log]] 
	1. If approved, The PM will adjust the [[Cards/Project Management Plan\|Project Management Plan]] and manage the project to the new plan in [[Cards/Direct and Manage Project Work\|Direct and Manage Project Work]] 
	2. If it is not approved, the team returns to the issue and develops a new [[Cards/Change Requests\|Change request]], repeating step 1.
