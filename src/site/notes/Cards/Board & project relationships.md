- [[Cards/What is a project board\|boards]] and [[Cards/What is a Jira project\|projects]] can be arranged to meet your work, tracking, and reporting needs. But, other types of relationships between [[Cards/What is a project board\|boards]] and [[Cards/What is a Jira project\|projects]] are also possible. 
	- ONE PROJECT, MANY BOARDS
		- A single project can have multiple boards.  For example, it may make sense to create individual boards for each team that only displays the issues they’re working on. . More information at [[Cards/Multiple boards for a project\|Multiple boards for a project]]
	- ONE BOARD, MANY PROJECTS
		- It’s also possible to have a single board that displays issues from multiple projects.  For example, you may want to create a master board to display issues from multiple related projects or from multiple teams.
