Agile's flexibility creates difficulty in outlining contract acceptance criteria.

Agile attempts to fix [[Cards/resources\|resources]] and time ([[costs\|costs]]) and vary functionality ([[Cards/Scope\|scope]])

> [!Note] For example
> You make a contract to paint a house. This contract is based on deliveries, which means a fixed [[Cards/Scope\|scope]], which is not in line with [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile]], because it is difficult to outline a contract's acceptance criteria. How does the contractor know the work is done? 

The solution is one of the [[Cards/Agile Guiding Principles\|Agile Guiding Principles]] is
- "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
	- ﻿﻿Close cooperation
	- ﻿﻿Active participation
	- ﻿﻿Timely and often feedback

# Examples of Contracts in Agile 
 - *Money for nothing and change for free* 
	 - Money for nothing:
		 - If we make a contract for 20 features and only develop 15, we give you all the money promised, even though we did not receive five features. 
	 - Change for free:
		 -  I should be able to change Feature #10 with Feature #16 without getting charged by the seller.
- Graduated Fixed Price Contract
	- Buyer and Seller share risks and rewards. How? 
		- Different hourly rates based on finishing time:
			- Finish early rate, Finish on-time rate, Finish late rate. 
- Fixed-price [[Cards/Work Packages\|Work Packages]] 
	- We look at each [[Cards/Work Packages\|Work Package]] and determine an individual cost. 
		- It helps mitigate the risks of under-over estimating. 

> [!Note]
> The most common of these is Fixed-price Work Packages. However, it is not uncommon to mix them.
