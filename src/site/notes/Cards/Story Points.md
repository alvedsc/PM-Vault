A story point is an abstract measure of effort necessary to accomplish a [[user story\|user story]] based on the complexity of completing it. In basic words, a [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Point]] is a number that informs the team of the tale's difficulty level. 

The [[Cards/Development Team\|Development Team]] also owns its definition of [[Cards/Story Points\|Story Points]]. However, they should be all-inclusive: The story point may be defined as the sum of complexity, dangers, and work required.

At [[Cards/Backlog Refinement\|Backlog Refinement]] sessions,Â [story points](https://chpokify.com/save-sprint-planning-time), a type of relative estimating, are generally conducted, and the [[Cards/Product Backlog\|product backlog]] is assessed by the team in charge of the actual development and testing work.

The team does not estimate the precise time needed to develop the feature while estimating narrative points. Instead, they assess the task's complexity.
