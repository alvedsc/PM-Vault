A technique that uses a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (for example, square footage in construction or lines of code in software development) to estimate activity parameters, such as [[Cards/Scope\|scope]], [[cost\|cost]], [[budget\|budget]], and [[schedule\|schedule]].
- for example, square footage in construction or lines of code in software development
	- Each square foot of paint equals 0.5 minutes

This type of estimation works for [[cost\|cost]], [[schedule\|schedule]]
