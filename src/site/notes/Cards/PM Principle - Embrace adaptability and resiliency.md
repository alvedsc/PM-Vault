Adaptability is the ability to *respond to changing conditions*.
- The environment, for example

Resiliency is the ability to *absorb impacts and recover quickly* from setbacks or failures.
- A team member is absent for an extended period

> [!Note]
A project rarely performs as initially planned. A focus on outcomes rather than outputs facilitates adaptability.

Projects are influenced by internal and external factors, like
- new requirements, 
- Issues (software, etc.)
- stakeholder influences, 
- among other factors which exist in a system of interactions.
