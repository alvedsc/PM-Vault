**Agile at scale** is the ability to drive agile at the team level while applying the same sustainable principles, practices, and outcomes at other layers of the organization.

**For example:**
- If agile teams do pre-sprint planning three days before a sprint begins, then product managers will want to do pre-quarter planning two to three weeks before the start of the quarter to ensure a properly prepared backlog across a team of agile teams.

# The Agile scaling journey

There are many ways to conceptualize the agile journey. One way is to think in terms of how teams and individuals adopt agile behaviors. Full enterprise agility doesn’t happen overnight.  It’s a process that happens gradually. Check the following **team levels**

1. **Beginning Agile**: Here, the team is still using a mix of waterfall and agile, but there are pockets of agile adoption.
2. **Consistent Agile**: Eventually, individual teams start to adopt agile more consistently.
3. **Teams of teams**: Then, one or more teams of teams will start practicing agile.
4. **Coordinated teams**: Next, multiple, cross-functional teams will act in agile coordination.
5. **Network of teams**: Finally, you'll achieve enterprise-wide agility all the way up to the leadership level.

# Scaling Agile tools

- *Transparency*: When your team's work is tracked in a tool, other teams (including your leadership team) have visibility into the work being done. Tools can serve as a **single source of truth to keep everyone on the same page**, even if they're not in the same office as you.
- *Consistency*: When individual product or program **teams track work in their own ways, a lack of consistency can make it hard to visualize work across multiple teams**.
- *Predictability*: Tools can help **calculate velocity, capacity, and other important measurements** to help you determine when your team's work will be on time (or not).
