[[Cards/Planning Performance Domain\|Planning]] in Agile is just like planning in [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]]. Planning is done throughout the [[Cards/Project\|project]]. However, in [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]], [[Cards/PM Principle - Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state\|change]] is avoided, while in [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]], it is encouraged.  This is due to the nature of the project, as observed in the [[Cards/Stacey Matrix\|Stacey Matrix]]. Moreover, in [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]] [[Cards/Scope\|scope]] is fixed, while in [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]], it is not known until the end of the [[Cards/Project\|project]], so it is not always possible to know what to plan for with too much time in advance. 

For this reason, changes occur because, during [[Cards/Sprint Review\|Sprint Review]] meetings, trials and demonstrations uncover true [[Cards/Requirements\|Requirements]]. (More information on [[Cards/Shared Vision\|Shared Vision]])

In [[Cards/Traditional Project Management\|Traditional Project Management]], for changes to happen, they need to go through the [[Cards/Perform Integrated Change Control\|Perform Integrated Change Control]] process. Conversely, in [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]], plans can change through multiple mechanisms, including:
- [[Cards/Sprint Planning\|Sprint Planning]] 
- [[Cards/Sprint Review\|Sprint Review]] 
- [[Cards/Retrospective\|Retrospective]] 
Moreover, changes require much less upfront effort and resistance in [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]], and adjustments mid-course are the norm. 

Also, in [[Cards/Agile Project Management\|Agile Project Management]], you always [[Cards/PM Principle - Focus on Value\|Focus on Value]] through [[Cards/Value-Based Prioritization\|Value-Based Prioritization]].
