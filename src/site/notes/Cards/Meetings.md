- ﻿﻿Meetings can be done face-to-face or virtually.
- ﻿﻿*Have an agenda and distribute it to all attendees before the meeting.*
- ﻿﻿Meetings *must be timed*, including setting start and finish times for topics and the entire meeting.
- ﻿﻿Ensure that the *meeting stays on topic.*
- ﻿﻿Ensure that all *attendees have input* on the topics.
	- If they don't have input, they may not belong in this meeting.
- ﻿﻿*Distribute detailed meeting minutes* once the meeting is complete.

> [!tip] 
> Getting everyone to participate in the first few minutes of the [[Cards/Meetings\|meeting]] is a great idea. This is so that they feel welcome into the [[Conversation\|Conversation]]. Introverts will always talk to you if they trust you, but not before that.
